And Seventeen Other Questions Raised by the New Atheists</h2><p>Sean McDowell and Jonathan Morrow have penned an accessible yet rigorous look at the arguments of the New Atheists. Writing from a distinctively Christian perspective, McDowell and Morrow lay out the facts so that the emerging generation can make up their own mind after considering all the evidence.</p><p>Atheism is making a comeback. From bookstores to bus campaigns, the question of God is up for public debate--and well-known atheists like Richard Dawkins and Christopher Hitchens are leading the charge. While these authors, who have been dubbed "The New Atheists," argue against religion in general, they aim most of their criticisms and complaints at the world's largest religion--Christianity. Why are people reading books that bash God and ridicule faith? And how can Christians respond? The writings of the New Atheists are especially challenging to the emerging generation who are skeptical of authority and have not been given answers to the hows and whys of faith's honest questions. For these readers especially, authors Sean McDowell and Jonathan Morrow have penned an accessible yet rigorous look at the arguments of the New Atheists. Writing from a distinctively Christian perspective, McDowell and Morrow lay out the facts so that the emerging generation can make up their own mind after considering all the evidence. Divided into two parts--the first addressing the scientific and philosophical challenges to belief in God and the second dealing with the moral and biblical challenges--Is God Just a Human Invention? will respond to each major argument in a way that is balanced, thorough, and easy to understand. <p>McDowell and Morrow believe that the current religious landscape is both an opportunity and a challenge for people of faith. Now is the time to respond.</p>Jonathan Morrow (MA and MDiv, Talbot School of Theology) is the author of <em>Welcome to College</em>, coauthor of <em>Is God Just a Human Invention?</em>, founder of www.thinkChristianly.org, and contributor to the Apologetics Study Bible for Students and Foundations of Spiritual Formation. Currently, he is the equipping pastor at Fellowship Bible Church in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, where he lives with his wife and two children.</p><h2>Once Upon a Time/Habia una vez: Traditional Latin American Tales/Cuentos tradicionales latinoamericanos (Bilingual English-Spanish)</h2><p><p>Enter an enchanted world of kings and giants, where cockroaches play dress-up and coyotes fly to the moon!

Ra�l vive en Nueva York.</p>MacArthur Fellow Mart�nez presents seven classic Latin American folktales of varying themes, all chosen because they are &#x201c;dear to his heart.&#x201d; Culled from diverse countries, including Argentina, Cuba, Mexico, Puerto Rico, and Spain, the stories feature characters such as Martina the Cockroach, the Wedding Rooster, Madremonte (Mother of the Jungle), and the trickster Tlacuache (opossum). Averaging a dozen pages of bilingual text in English and Spanish, each story features a colorful, appealing full-page illustration, and attentive viewers may catch a few discrepancies between the images and the scenes described in the words. On one page, for example, the Mother of the Jungle appears with short tresses while the text states that she has &#x201c;extremely long hair.&#x201d; Mart�nez occasionally relies on choppy non sequiturs, and his narratives lack the literary and folkloric flair of Alma Flor Ada and F. Isabel Campoy&#x2019;s work. Nonetheless, his interpretations read aloud well (especially in Spanish) and make a strong contribution to a still relatively empty canon of bilingual, Latin American folktale offerings. Grades 1-4. --Andrew Medlar</p><h2>Ren� Girard's Mimetic Theory (Studies in Violence, Mimesis &amp; Culture)</h2><p>A systematic introduction into the mimetic theory of the French-American literary theorist and philosophical anthropologist Ren� Girard, this essential text explains its three main pillars (mimetic desire, the scapegoat mechanism, and the Biblical &#x201c;difference&#x201d;) with the help of examples from literature and philosophy. This book also offers an overview of Ren� Girard&#x2019;s life and work, showing how much mimetic theory results from existential and spiritual insights into one&#x2019;s own mimetic entanglements. Furthermore it examines the broader implications of Girard&#x2019;s theories, from the mimetic aspect of sovereignty and wars to the relationship between the scapegoat mechanism and the question of capital punishment. Mimetic theory is placed within the context of current cultural and political debates like the relationship between religion and modernity, terrorism, the death penalty, and gender issues. Drawing textual examples from European literature (Cervantes, Shakespeare, Goethe, Kleist, Stendhal, Storm, Flaubert, Dostoevsky, Proust) and philosophy (Plato, Camus, Sartre, L�vi-Strauss, Derrida, Vattimo), Palaver uses mimetic theory to explore the themes they present. A highly accessible book, this text is complemented by bibliographical references to Girard&#x2019;s widespread work and secondary literature on mimetic theory and its applications, comprising a valuable bibliographical archive that provides the reader with an overview of the development and discussion of mimetic theory until the present day.</p><p><p><b>Wolfgang Palaver </b>is Professor of Catholic Social Thought and Chair of the Institute for Systematic Theology at the University of Innsbruck. He is a member of the advisory board of Imitatio, a nonprofit organization dedicated to Ren� Girard&#x2019;s mimetic theory.</p>Palaver's survey of Girard's mimetic theory is the most thorough introduction to Girard's thought and its ramifications that has been written, uniting profound insight, clear explication, and a tremendous breadth of research.<br>--James Williams, author of <i>The Bible, Violence, and the Sacred&nbsp;</i>and editor of <i>The Girard Reader</i><br><br><br><br><p>A real tour de force, Palaver succeeds in situating mimetic theory in regard to major trends in contemporary thought, to document its relevance and contributions to various disciplines while simultaneously providing the most comprehensive and accessible introduction in any language. </p>&#x2014;Paul Dumouchel, Ritsumeikan University<br><br><br><br><p>Wolfgang Palaver&#x2019;s exploration of Rene Girard&#x2019;s mimetic theory is comprehensive, thorough, and penetrating. He takes us into the heart of Girard&#x2019;s anthropology of desire, while also tracing its rich implications for the contemporary study of politics, culture, gender, and religion. This English translation now makes available to a wider audience the definitive &#x201c;must-read&#x201d; account of one of the most important theoretical projects of our time.</p>&#x2014;Bruce K. Ward, Laurentian University<br><br><br><p>First published in German in 2003, Wolfgang Palaver&#x2019;s <i>Ren� Girard&#x2019;s Mimetic Theory</i> is a crucially important addition to the growing body of English-language studies of Girard&#x2019;s work. Clear, comprehensive, analytically acute, this volume shows Palaver to be a worthy successor to his Austrian colleague, Raymund Schwager, as Girard&#x2019;s interpreter and collaborator. The rich fruit of annual lectures over a period of ten years, <i>Ren� Girard&#x2019;s Mimetic Theory</i> not only describes that theory, placing it in comparison and contrast with the theories of other major twentieth-century intellectuals concerning religion, mimesis, desire, and violence, it also shows why and how Girard&#x2019;s insights are increasingly relevant today. Braiding together topically related discussions of literary fiction, Biblical texts, philosophy, anthropology, psychology, political science, and theology, Palaver reflects, imitates, and extends Girard&#x2019;s own inter-disciplinarity in a breathtaking, scholarly tour de force.</p><p>&#x2014;Ann W.

Here, pioneering therapist Stephanie Brown, Ph.D., helps readers understand that leaving behind the numbing comfort of alcohol or other drugs means you must face yourself, perhaps for the first time. With personal stories and gentle guidance, Brown helps readers unravel painful truths and confusing feelings in the process of creating a new, true sense of self.</p><p>Stephanie Brown, PH.D., is a pioneering researcher, clinician, author, teacher, and consultant in the addiction field.

In this first-of-its-kind book, psychotherapist Jeanne Safer takes us into the hidden world of problem siblings and explores the far-reaching effects on the lives of those who are considered the &#x201c;normal ones.&#x201d;<br> <br>Drawing on more than sixty interviews with normal, or intact, siblings, Safer explores the daunting challenges they face, and probes the complex feelings that can strain families and damage lives. A &#x201c;normal&#x201d; sibling herself, Safer chronicles her own life-shaping experiences with her troubled brother. She examines the double-edged reality of normal ones: how they both compensate for their siblings&#x2019; abnormality and feel guilty for their own health and success. With both wisdom and empathy, she delineates the &#x201c;Caliban Syndrome,&#x201d; a set of personality traits characteristic of higher-functioning siblings: premature maturity, compulsion to achieve, survivor guilt, and fear of contagion.<br><br>Essential reading for normal ones and those who love them, this landmark work offers readers insight, compassion, and tools to help resolve childhood pain. It is a profound and eye-opening examination of a subject that has too long been shrouded in darkness.</p><p>"<b>The Normal One</b> provides a great service for the siblings of truly damaged individuals, those quiet, self-denying brothers and sisters who, perhaps for the first time in their lives, will recognize in Safer a passionate advocate from the world of psychotherapy, speaking out on their behalf with a deeply intelligent, fully informed, and thoroughly welcome voice."<br>--<i>The New York Times Book Review<br><br></i>"Revelatory...an indelible, brave, profoundly sensitive, and deeply personal look at how the &#x2018;normal&#x2019; half lives, loves, resents, reconciles, sometimes denies, sometimes transcends, aches for&#x2014;but never quite trusts&#x2014;the consolations of family."<br>--<i>O Magazine</i> <br><br>"[A] persuasive examination of the considerable effect that...impaired brothers and sisters have upon their &#x2018;normal&#x2019; siblings throughout life."<br>--<i>The New York Times Book Review<br><br></i><b>Jeanne Safer, PhD,</b>&nbsp;is a psychotherapist who in her 40 years of private practice has tackled difficult issues that most people deem &#x201c;taboo,&#x201d; including siblings with difficult or dysfunctional brothers and sisters, women making choices about motherhood, and adults struggling about whether to forgive people who have betrayed them.

Time and again the cobbled lanes and harbor-side, gas-lit neighborhoods drew her to return, and on one of those later visits she met the man who would become her husband. Always a lover of history, Alyssa found that marrying into a large, generations-old Newport family opened up an exciting new world of historical discovery. From the graveyards whose earliest markers read from the seventeenth century, to original colonial houses still lived in today, to the Newport Artillery Company whose curator for many years was her husband&#x2019;s grandfather, Newport became a place of fascination and romantic charm.&nbsp;Today, Maxwell and her husband reside in Florida with their two adult daughters, but part of her heart remains firmly in that small New England city of great significance, a microcosm of American history spanning from before the Revolution through the Civil War, the Industrial Age, the Gilded Age, and beyond.

The family discusses what they will be giving up for Lent, and Nick and Sam experience some struggles with their choices throughout the Lenten season. A new boy, Riley, comes into their class who is obsessed with Big Foot, and he and Nick get into some strange adventures seeking the famous creature. Sam enters the school spelling bee, and she struggles with temptation when someone tries to help her cheat. The kids learn about temptations, sacrifices, poverty, and the love of Jesus along the way.

They moved with their parents, their brother Andrew, and their sister Lizzy, to Hope Springs in the summer. Hope Springs is a fictional town in the mountains of Colorado. This series presents the adventures of the twins, their family, their friends, and the people they encounter at school, church, and in town. This series presents Catholic culture easily and normally, and provides opportunities for readers to think about the consequences of words and actions. Some of the chapters early in the series appear in the Signs of Grace curriculum, and the Hope Springs universe expands out to McCusker's Blue Christmas, and will be featured in other stories to come. This series is written similarly to the Adventures in Odyssey series and the Magic Tree House series, and is recommended for readers ages seven and up, but can also be read by parents to younger children.</p><p>Paul McCusker is an American writer most widely known for Adventures in Odyssey, but he has worked on many other types of writing projects: novels, plays, musicals, radio dramas, and movie scripts.

He is a convert to Catholicism, and lives in Colorado Springs, Colorado with his wife and children.</p><h2>Becoming Friends of Time: Disability, Timefullness, and Gentle Discipleship (Studies in Religion, Theology, and Disability)</h2><p><p>Time is central to all that humans do. Time structures days, provides goals, shapes dreams&#x2015;and limits lives. Time appears to be tangible, real, and progressive, but, in the end, time proves illusory.&nbsp;Though mercurial, time can be deadly for those with disabilities.&nbsp;To participate fully in human society has come to mean yielding to the criterion of the clock. The absence of thinking rapidly, living punctually, and biographical narration leaves persons with disabilities vulnerable. A worldview driven by the demands the clock makes on the lives of those with dementia or profound neurological and intellectual disabilities seems pointless.<br>&nbsp;<br>And yet, Jesus comes to the world to transform time. Jesus calls us to slow down, take time, and learn to recognize the strangeness of living within God&#x2019;s time. He calls us to be gentle, patient, kind; to walk slowly and timefully with those whom society desires to leave behind. <br>&nbsp;<br>In <i>Becoming Friends of Time</i>, John Swinton crafts a theology of time that draws us toward a perspective wherein time is a gift and a calling. Time is not a commodity nor is time to be mastered. Time is a gift of God to humans, but is also a gift given back to God by humans.<br>&nbsp;<br>Swinton wrestles with critical questions that emerge from theological reflection on time and disability: rethinking doctrine for those who can never grasp Jesus with their intellects; reimagining discipleship and vocation for those who have forgotten who Jesus is; reconsidering salvation for those who, due to neurological damage, can be one person at one time and then be someone else in an instant. In the end, Swinton invites the reader to spend time with the experiences of people with profound neurological disability, people who can change our perceptions of time, enable us to grasp the fruitful rhythms of God&#x2019;s time, and help us learn to live in ways that are unimaginable within the boundaries of the time of the clock.</p></p><p><p>John Swinton is Professor in Practical Theology and Pastoral Care at the University of Aberdeen in Scotland. He was given the Oskar Pfister Award by the American Psychiatric Association for making an outstanding contribution to religion and psychiatry in 2018.</p><p>This wonderfully thought-provoking book by John Swinton takes its cue from such profoundly disabled people to argue that many of the challenges they face would be overcome if time were on their side.</p> (Penny Seabrook <i>Church Times</i>)<br><br><p>Theologically rich and pastorally astute.</p> (Aaron Klink <i>Religious Studies Review</i>)<br><br><p>[Swinton's] theological and experiential reflections offer real ways to reimagine discipleship alongside those within life&#x2019;s range of varying differing abilities. Swinton acts as an important and necessary conversation partner for academics and pastors who rely heavily on 'normal' cognitive and neurological development, freeing those with rigid conceptions of practical theology to active, contextual care.</p> (Adam Tobey <i>Reading Religion</i>)<br><br><p>Creative, thoughtful, and convicting.</p> (Bruce M.

(Pere Marquette Theology Lecture)</h2><p>The consequences of becoming a Christian in the early Christian movemen is set apart from that move from any other religious affiliation. You could become a Mithraist or Isiac or whatever, and it made no difference to your previous religious activities and loyalties. You continued to take part in the worship of your inherited deities of household, city, nation. But if you became a Christian you were expected to desist from worship of all other deities. And the ubiquitous place of the gods in all spheres of social and political activity made that difficult, and made for potentially serious consequences if you did desist. Indeed, it made it difficult to know how you could function socially and politically (to use our terminology).This book explores the growth of adherents to early Christianity; that all across this early period people became adherents of Christianity in the face of the costs and consequences of doing so.</p><p>Larry W.

From Isabella of Castile, and her granddaughter Mary Tudor, to Catherine de Medici, Anne Boleyn, and Elizabeth Tudor, these women wielded enormous power over their territories, shaping the course of European history for over a century. Across boundaries and generations, these royal women were mothers and daughters, mentors and prot�g�es, allies and enemies. For the first time, Europe saw a sisterhood of queens who would not be equaled until modern times. A fascinating group biography and a thrilling political epic, <i>Game of Queens</i> explores the lives of some of the most beloved (and reviled) queens in history.<b><br></b></p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of December 2016:</strong> When chess was first played, all the human figures were male. Only around the eight century did the Queen appear and not until the sixteenth century did the Queen become the most powerful piece in chess. Credit for this development is given to Isabella of Spain, the &#x201c;warrior queen,&#x201d; herself a skillful and enthusiastic chess player. Coincidentally, from Isabella&#x2019;s accession to the throne in 1474 through the next hundred years, an Age of Queens flourished to a degree not seen before or since, with women on the thrones of many European countries. Both the influence of chess and Isabella of Spain feature heavily in Game of Queens. Though few of the female regents met one another, the passage of power and influence (including strategic chess plays) flowed from mothers to daughters and from mentors to protegees, across borders and across generations. The stories of some of the greatest (and hated) queens are told here (in an amusing author&#x2019;s note, Gristwood points out that in a story with sixteen protagonists, eight of them are named either Mary or Margaret and she absolves herself of responsibility for any confusion that may result). Against a backdrop of religious reformations and the innovations of the new age, Gristwood deftly shows how the explosion of female rule came about, the machinations and power plays behind the thrones, and how the Age of Queens ultimately played out; unsurprisingly, fidelity and fertility were used to create scandals that threatened to topple each Queen. From Isabella of Castile and her granddaughter Mary Tudor, to Catherine de Medici, Anne Boleyn, and Elizabeth Tudor, what could be a dry examination of policy and power becomes, in Gristwood&#x2019;s hands, a lively, accessible, occasionally hilarious, absorbing account of an astonishing era. <em>--Vannessa Cronin, The Amazon Book Review</em><b>Sarah Gristwood</b> is a regular contributor to many London publications as well as a commentator on royal and historical affairs.

Irreverent at times, yet always insightful, this volume features classic entries and all new, exclusive material that was born out of artist David Wilkie's frustration with the polarized political climate in America. "Originally created as a one-off, single-panel comic on my blog, utilizing old advertising clip art for the main characters and Sunday school clip art for the person of Jesus, I simply enjoyed the notion of Jesus appearing at table with these people (dressed as they were and sharing coffee with them) to refute their claims of how he might vote on any particular issue, to convince them that they cannot confuse their flag with their God&#x2015;to set them straight, as it were," explains Wilkie. But it didn?t stop here. Soon the Jesus of <em>Coffee with Jesus</em> could be seen offering counsel to a recurring cast of characters on their personal and work lives. The characters&#x2015;Carl, Lisa, Ann, Kevin and Joe&#x2015;all honestly engage with Jesus about their successes and failures and wants and needs, effectively showing what conversation with God&#x2015;or prayer&#x2015;might look like. Poignant, pointed, and rife with good theology, <em> Coffee with Jesus</em> is organized around six themes: getting to know Jesus, spiritual disciplines, relationships, culture, church, and the challenges of life. With exclusive material like twelve-panel mega-strips and "behind the strip" reflections on life, faith and art, Wilkie inventively poses answers to the perpetual Christian speculation, "What would Jesus do?"</p><p><strong>David J. Wilkie</strong> is the cofounder of Radio Free Babylon, a consortium of artists, writers and other cultural creatives."The cheeky, online comic strip that has gained a cult audience of 40,000-plus followers in less than three years is now ready to burst upon the world as a giftable, brightly hued coffee-table book. . . . The wit is barbed, theology surprisingly relevant, and the overall effect highly addictive." (John Muraski, Religion News Service, December 2013)<br><br>"We have much to be thankful for in Wilkie's creative work here, and the ways in which it ever so gently prods us toward a deeper understanding of who Jesus is and what it means to follow him in our times." (Chris Smith, Englewood Review of Books, Advent 2013)<br><br>"David Wilkie accomplishes in a four-panel comic strip what preachers try to achieve in a 45-minute sermon&#x2015;making one solid point that delivers a spiritual truth. Wilkie's popular <em>Coffee with Jesus</em> strip invites the reader to eavesdrop on conversations between Jesus and a diverse cast of characters as they discuss everyday topics including relationships, culture, and church. Worship leaders will gain insight into the types of questions and issues real-life people struggle with daily." (Jeff Friend, Worship Leader Magazine, January/February 2014)<br><br>"Irreverent yet insightful." (Heidi Schlumpf, National Catholic Reporter, December 9, 2013)<br><br>"This collection of strip cartoons, originally seen online, uses the simplest means&#x2015;clip art&#x2015;to the richest ends: disarmingly funny reflections on human failings and faith, featuring stock characters in conversation with an amusing and amused Jesus. Revelatory." (Library Journal's Best Books 2013, December 2013)<br><br>"The heart is the comic collection and its humor, at once gentle and barbed and more thought-provoking than many a sermon.

Recommend <em>Coffee With Jesus</em> to youth and young adults." (CBA Retailers + Resources, December 2013)<br><br>"It's a comic strip, so it's funny, right? Yes, of course. But it's also poignant, and pointed. And rife with good theology. So read it for a laugh, but be prepared to be challenged as well. Jesus probably has something to say to you too." (Tony Jones, blogger and theologian)<br><br>"I remember when the 'What Would Jesus Do?' tsunami almost completely engulfed all of us who worked with teenagers. Suddenly, we felt compelled to provide an answer to that impossible question. Problem was: most of us didn't really have a clue what Jesus would do, really. And any honest reading of the Gospels reveals that his disciples didn't know what Jesus would do either. <em>Coffee with Jesus</em> steps into that same tension, responding with plucky, snarky and occasionally awkward honesty. We don't really know the full answer to 'What Would Jesus Say?' But I'd sure like it to be close to the Jesus in these panels."

And so, there are few things of greater value than the achievement of health and physical well-being. &#34;;Not only does a good-feeling body promote positive thoughts, but, also, positive thoughts promote a good-feeling body. It is our expectation that as you ponder these cards, a new point of attraction will begin to be activated within you that eventually can lead to a</p><p>Excited about the clarity and practicality of the translated word from the Beings who call themselves Abraham, Esther and Jerry Hicks began disclosing their amazing Abraham experience to a handful of close business associates in 1986. Recognizing the practical results being received by themselves and by those people who were asking practical questions and then applying Abraham&#x2019;s answers to their own situations, Esther and Jerry made a deliberate decision to allow the teachings of Abraham to become available to an ever-widening circle of seekers of how to live a happier life. Using their San Antonio, Texas, conference center as their base, Jerry and Esther have traveled to approximately 50 cities a year since 1989, presenting interactive Law of Attraction workshops to those leaders who gather to participate in this expanding stream of progressive thought. And although worldwide attention has been given to this philosophy of Well-Being by Leading Edge thinkers and teachers who have, in turn, incorporated many of Abraham&#x2019;s Law of Attraction concepts into their best-selling books, scripts, lectures, and so forth, the primary spread of this material has been from person to person&#x2014;as individuals begin to discover the value of this form of spiritual practicality in their personal life experiences. In November 2011, Jerry made his transition into Non-Physical, and now Esther continues to conduct the Abraham workshops with the help of her physical friends and co-workers and, of course, with the Non-Physical help of Abraham and Jerry. People are able to access Abraham directly by attending the seminars in person or by participating in the online live streaming of most events. There is also an extensive YouTube library of Abraham videos. Abraham&#x2014;a group of uplifting Non-Physical teachers&#x2014;present their Broader Perspective through Esther Hicks. And as they speak to our level of comprehension through a series of loving, allowing, brilliant, yet comprehensively simple essays in print and in sound, they guide us to a clear connection with our loving Inner Being, and to uplifting self-empowerment from our Total Self.

A gripping Myron Bolitar novel from the SUNDAY TIMES bestselling author of TELL NO ONE and SIX YEARS.</b></p><p>Life isn't going well for Myron Bolitar. His business is struggling, and his father, recently recovered from a heart attack, is facing his own mortality - and forcing Myron to face it too. Then Emily Downing, Myron's college sweetheart, reappears in his life with devastating news: her thirteen-year-old son Jeremy is gravely ill and can be saved only by a bone-marrow transplant - from a donor who has vanished without trace.</p><p>Before Myron can absorb this revelation, Emily hits him with an even bigger shocker: Jeremy is Myron's son, conceived the night before Emily's wedding to another man. Staggered by the news, Myron plunges into a search for the missing donor. But for Myron, finding the only person who can save the boy's life means cracking open a mystery that involves a broken family, a brutal kidnapping spree, and a cat-and-mouse game between an ambitious reporter and the FBI.</p></p><p>Myron Bolitar's father's recent heart attack brings Myron smack into a midlife encounter with issues of adulthood and mortality. And if that's not enough to turn his life upside down, the reappearance of his first serious girlfriend is. The basketball star turned sports agent, who does a little detecting when business is slow, is saddened by the news that Emily Downing's 13-year-old son is dying and desperately needs a bone marrow transplant; even if she did leave him for the man who destroyed his basketball career, he wouldn't wish tsuris like that on anyone. And he's not at all interested in getting involved with Emily again, not even to track down the one mysterious donor who may be able to save the boy. But when Myron learns that Jeremy Downing is his <i>own</i> son, conceived the night before Emily and Greg Downing married, he embarks on a search for someone who disappeared a lifetime ago. And what he finds leads him to a powerful family determined to keep an old secret, a disgraced reporter who may have plagiarized a novel to create a serial killer, a very interested FBI agent, and a missing child. <p> This is the seventh outing in a series that's been gaining in popularity since Bolitar's first appearance, in Harlan Coben's <i>Deal Breaker</i>. Myron's a bit of a baby, but he's not afraid to get rough when the situation calls for it, he's eminently likable, and his heart's in the right place. The fireworks are supplied by his friend and partner, Win, who really deserves a series of his own, and Esperanza, the lesbian wrestler-lawyer who has finally talked Myron into making her a partner in the business. Like Coben's other Bolitar novels, she's worth every penny. <i>--Jane Adams</i></p>6 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Torch (Vintage Contemporaries)</h2><p><b>In her debut novel, the bestselling author of <i>Wild</i>&nbsp;weaves a searing and luminous tale of a family's grief after unexpected loss. </b><br><br>"Work hard.

I don&#x2019;t remember who. It was pure white and had a small golden lock that opened with a small golden key that was also meant to re-secure the lock, but never did. I loved that diary. I remember very distinctly knowing it was the best gift I&#x2019;d ever received. I filled it with stories about princesses and kings, about horses ridden by girls whose fathers drove around in fancy cars. I wrote about things that were nothing about me.<br> &nbsp;<br> When I was eleven a poet came to my school to teach a class for several days. She was called a poet-in-the-school, a special guest, a rare occurrence. Every minute she spoke it was like someone was holding a lit match to the most flammable, secret parts of me. One day the poet-in-the-school explained what metaphors were and then asked us to write a whole poem composed of them. I was a lion. I was an icicle. I was a kaleidoscope. I was a torn-up page. I was glass that other people took to be stone. Another day she told us we could write poems about our memories. She asked us to close our eyes and think for a while about when we were younger and then open our eyes and write. I wrote about running down the sidewalk in what I called &#x201c;beautiful, filthy Pittsburgh&#x201d; in my paint-speckled sneakers when I was five.<br> &nbsp;<br> A week later the principal summoned me to his office. When I arrived he explained from behind his big desk that the poet-in-the-school had showed him my poem. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re a good writer!&#x201d; he exclaimed. His name was Mr. Menzel. He was the first person to ever say this to me. He handed me a copy of my poem and asked if I would read it out loud to him and I did, mortified but also happy. After I was done reading he said it was surprising that I&#x2019;d described Pittsburgh as being beautiful and filthy because most people would think it could not be both things at once. &#x201c;Keep writing, Cheryl,&#x201d; he said.<br> &nbsp;<br> I kept writing.<br> &nbsp;<br> I didn&#x2019;t know that by doing so I was becoming a writer. I knew people wrote books, but it didn&#x2019;t occur to me that I could be one of them until I was twenty and a junior at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, enrolled in an introductory poetry class taught by Michael Dennis Browne. I learned a lot in that class. I came to understand language in a way I&#x2019;d never understood it. I wrote my first serious (though lousy) poems. But most important, I got to be in a room a few times a week with a writer who&#x2019;d written not just one book, but many, and it was only then that it dawned on me that even though the gap between who he was and who I was seemed enormous, maybe&#x2014;just maybe&#x2014;I could bridge that gap and someday be a person who wrote a book too.<br> &nbsp;<br> I&#x2019;ve often been asked how long it took me to write <i>Torch</i>. There are three answers to this question and they are all true: four years, seven years, and thirty-four years. But the last answer is the truest. <i>Torch</i> is born of the little white diary with the lock that wouldn&#x2019;t work, the poet-in-the-school who taught me what a metaphor was, the principal who said keep writing, the writer whose existence showed me the way. They are not in the acknowledgments of this book, but they are in its blood. <i>Torch</i> is the story I had broiling in my bones for the first thirty-four years of my life. It&#x2019;s the story I felt I could not live without telling. The one that made me think I could die when I finished writing it (though I can&#x2019;t and don&#x2019;t want to). Perhaps every writer has this relationship to his or her first book. I worked my tail off when I wrote my other books, Wild and Tiny Beautiful Things, but <i>Torch</i> is the book that taught me how to write a book and because of that it was the one that demanded the deepest faith, the greatest leap, the furthest reach.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Torch</i> is a novel about a family in rural northern Minnesota during a time of great loss. Because I grew up in a place not unlike the place depicted in the novel and because my family experienced a great loss not unlike that of the Wood/Gunther family in the book, many people read <i>Torch</i> as if it&#x2019;s nonfiction, but it is not. Like a lot of novelists, I drew on my life experiences while writing <i>Torch</i>&#x2014;those who&#x2019;ve read my other books will undoubtedly recognize some details about my mother and her death and the general landscape and culture of rural Aitkin County, Minnesota, where I came of age&#x2014;but the autobiographical elements were only the seeds from which I created a fictional world.<br> &nbsp;<br> Though it&#x2019;s true my family and I listened to radio shows of the sort Teresa Wood hosts in Torch on the very real community station KAXE, my mother wasn&#x2019;t a radio show host and I can&#x2019;t imagine she&#x2019;d have wanted to be, given the opportunity. My brother didn&#x2019;t go to jail for dealing methamphetamines like Joshua Wood does. My stepfather wasn&#x2019;t an only child who obsessively listened to the music of Kenny G in his grief like Bruce Gunther does. I didn&#x2019;t have an affair while my mother lay dying in a hospital in Duluth like Claire Wood does.<br> &nbsp;<br> In writing <i>Torch</i>, I wanted to tell a story that had no obligation to what actually happened and yet what happened had everything to do with my need to write <i>Torch</i>. One of the great paradoxes of writing fiction is that it&#x2019;s often only through imagination that a writer can reveal the greatest truth. I certainly felt that way as I wrote <i>Torch</i>. I don&#x2019;t know precisely what it meant for my stepfather to lose his wife or for my siblings to lose their mother, but in <i>Torch</i> I tried very hard to know. Fic- tion gave me license to seek. It allowed me to tell the only story I could at the time, one that exceeded the bounds of my own particular grief&#x2014;a grief that was so enormous I couldn&#x2019;t hold it alone. I needed to cast it into other bodies, other minds, and also to pay those other people their due. They had lost my mother too. I put the story of my family&#x2019;s sorrow on a larger, mostly make-believe stage so I could make sense of how any of us had managed to come out the other side. In doing so, my allegiance wasn&#x2019;t accuracy. It was emotional truth.<br> &nbsp;<br> That&#x2019;s what I mean when I tell you that <i>Torch</i> was broiling in my bones. It was the story of my life and yet I made everything up. I created characters, even as I felt the people I knew and loved in every word I wrote. I set the story in a place that both was and was not home. I named the town in <i>Torch</i> Midden&#x2014;the medieval word for a communal garbage heap&#x2014;not because I wanted to imply my beloved hometown of McGregor was a dump, but because a midden is the most valuable find when archeologists do their excavations. It&#x2019;s the place where we recover the hidden treasures, both grand and mundane. In middens, the story of a people and a place can be found, but only if we dig.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Torch</i> is the result of my first sustained effort at digging. When I scratched beneath the surface as I wrote it, I came to understand I didn&#x2019;t know what I was going to find as each layer revealed itself. It was only after I&#x2019;d finished that I could see what I&#x2019;d done: written a novel not only about grief and loss, but also about love in its many forms, about how we find light in the midst of the most profound darkness, about how we survive what we think we will not. And it&#x2019;s only from this vantage point&#x2014;years after <i>Torch</i> was first published&#x2014;that I can see all of my books are about that. How things can be both beautiful and filthy at once.<br> &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Chapter 1</b><br> &nbsp;<br> She ached. As if her spine were a zipper and someone had come up behind her and unzipped it and pushed his hands into her organs and squeezed, as if they were butter or dough, or grapes to be smashed for wine. At other times it was something sharp like diamonds or shards of glass engraving her bones. Teresa explained these sensations to the doctor&#x2014;the zipper, the grapes, the diamonds, and the glass&#x2014; while he sat on his little stool with wheels and wrote in a note- book. He continued to write after she&#x2019;d stopped speaking, his head cocked and still like a dog listening to a sound that was distinct, but far off. It was late afternoon, the end of a long day of tests, and he was the final doctor, the <i>real</i> doctor, the one who would tell her at last what was wrong.<br> &nbsp;<br> Teresa held her earrings in the palm of one hand&#x2014;dried violets pressed between tiny panes of glass&#x2014;and put them on, still getting dressed after hours of going from one room to the next in a hospital gown. She examined her shirt for lint and cat hair, errant pieces of thread, and primly picked them off. She looked at Bruce, who looked out the window at a ship in the harbor, which cut elegantly, tranquilly along the surface of the lake, as if it weren&#x2019;t January, as if it weren&#x2019;t Minnesota, as if it weren&#x2019;t ice.<br> &nbsp;<br> At the moment she wasn&#x2019;t in pain and she told the doctor this while he wrote. &#x201c;There are long stretches of time that I feel perfectly fine,&#x201d; she said, and laughed the way she did with strangers. She confessed that she wouldn&#x2019;t be surprised if she were going mad or perhaps this was the beginning of menopause or maybe she had walking pneumonia. Walking pneumonia had been her latest theory, the one she liked best. The one that explained the cough, the ache. The one that could have made her spine into a zipper.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;d like to have one more glance,&#x201d; the doctor said, looking up at her as if he had risen from a trance. He was young. Younger. <i>Was he thirty</i>? she wondered. He instructed her to take her clothes off again and gave her a fresh gown to wear and then left the room.<br> &nbsp;<br> She undressed slowly, tentatively at first, and then quickly, crouching, as if Bruce had never seen her naked. The sun shone into the room and made everything lilac.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The light&#x2014;it&#x2019;s so pretty,&#x201d; she said, and stepped up to sit on the examining table. A rosy slice of her abdomen peeped out from a gap in the gown, and she mended it shut with her hands. She was thirsty but not allowed a drop of water. Hungry, from having not eaten since the night before. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m starving.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s good,&#x201d; said Bruce. &#x201c;Appetite means that you&#x2019;re healthy.&#x201d; His face was red and dry and cracked-looking, as if he&#x2019;d just come in from plowing the driveway, though he&#x2019;d been with her all day, going from one section of the hospital to the next, reading what he could find in the waiting rooms. Reading <i>Reader&#x2019;s Digest</i> and <i>Newsweek</i> and <i>Self</i> against his will but reading hungrily, avidly, from cover to cover. Throughout the day, in the small spaces of time in which she too had had to wait, he&#x2019;d told her the stories. About an old woman who&#x2019;d been bludgeoned to death by a boy she&#x2019;d hired to build a dog- house. About a movie star who&#x2019;d been forced by divorce to sell his boat. About a man in Kentucky who&#x2019;d run a marathon in spite of the fact that he had only one foot, the other made of metal, a complicated, sturdy coil fitted into a shoe.<br> &nbsp;<br> The doctor knocked, then burst in without waiting for an answer. He washed his hands and brought his little black instrument out, the one with the tiny light, and peered into her eyes, her ears, her mouth. She could smell the cinnamon gum he chewed and also the soap he&#x2019;d used before he touched her. She kept herself from blinking while staring directly into the bullet of light, and then, when he asked, followed his pen expertly around the room using only her eyes.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not a sickly woman,&#x201d; she declared.<br> &nbsp;<br> Nobody agreed. Nobody disagreed. But Bruce came to stand behind her and rub her back.<br> &nbsp;<br> His hands made a scraping sound against the fabric of the gown, so rough and thick they were, like tree bark. At night he cut the calluses off with a jackknife.<br> &nbsp;<br> The doctor didn&#x2019;t say cancer&#x2014;at least she didn&#x2019;t hear him say it. She heard him say oranges and peas and radishes and ovaries and lungs and liver. He said tumors were growing like wildfire along her spine.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What about my brain?&#x201d; she asked, dry-eyed.<br> &nbsp;<br> He told her he&#x2019;d opted not to check her brain because her ovaries and lungs and liver made her brain irrelevant. &#x201c;Your breasts are fine,&#x201d; he said, leaning against the sink.<br> &nbsp;<br> She blushed to hear that. <i>Your breasts are fine.</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; she said, and leant forward a bit in her chair. Once, she&#x2019;d walked six miles through the streets of Duluth in honor of women whose breasts <i>weren&#x2019;t</i> fine and in return she&#x2019;d received a pink T-shirt and a spaghetti dinner.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What does this mean exactly?&#x201d; Her voice was reasonable beyond reason. She became acutely aware of each muscle in her face. Some were paralyzed, others twitched. She pressed her cold hands against her cheeks.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to alarm you,&#x201d; the doctor said, and then, very calmly, he stated that she could not expect to be alive in one year. He talked for a long time in simple terms, but she could not make out what he was saying. When she&#x2019;d first met Bruce, she&#x2019;d asked him to explain to her how, precisely, the engine of a car worked. She did this because she loved him and she wanted to demonstrate her love by taking an interest in his knowledge. He&#x2019;d sketched the parts of an engine on a napkin and told her what fit together and what parts made other parts move and he also took several detours to explain what was likely to be happening when certain things went wrong and the whole while she had smiled and held her face in an expression of simulated intelligence and understanding, though by the end she&#x2019;d learned absolutely nothing. This was like that.<br> &nbsp;<br> She didn&#x2019;t look at Bruce, couldn&#x2019;t bring herself to. She heard a hiccup of a cry from his direction and then a long horrible cough.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; she said when the doctor was done talking. &#x201c;I mean, for doing everything you can do.&#x201d; And then she added weakly, &#x201c;But. There&#x2019;s one thing&#x2014;are you sure? Because... actually... I don&#x2019;t feel that sick.&#x201d; She felt she&#x2019;d know it if she had oranges growing in her; she&#x2019;d known immediately both times that she&#x2019;d been pregnant.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;That will come. I would expect extremely soon,&#x201d; said the doctor. He had a dimpled chin, a baby face. &#x201c;This is a rare situation&#x2014;to find it so late in the game. Actually, the fact that we found it so late speaks to your overall good health. Other than this, you&#x2019;re in excellent shape.&#x201d;<br><br> He hoisted himself up to sit on the counter, his legs dangling and swinging.<br><br> &#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; she said again, reaching for her coat.</p><h2>The Hidden Man (Jason Kolarich)</h2><p>Jason Kolarich is a Chicago attorney with a lineman&#39;s build, a razor- sharp intellect-and the grief of a tragic personal loss.

Normal. Like everyone else.</p><p>Not different. Not like a freak. Just another person at the park.</p><p>It was a beautiful day, a glorious weekend in June, so bright you had to squint, so mild you didn&#x2019;t feel the air. The playground was a perfect chaos, abuzz with children&#x2019;s high-pitched squeals and whining pleas, parents calling after them in scolding voices, various playground contraptions in full animation, like busy turbines propelling the jubilant park.</p><p>Audrey. That was the name they called her. A surge of vicarious joy, watching her, her purity, her unadulterated innocence before the world turns cruel.</p><p>I feel like you sometimes. Like a child still. A child trapped in a grown-up&#x2019;s body.</p><p>Audrey. She wore pink overalls and a bonnet with polka dots. Her tiny forehead crinkled in concentration as she gathered the sand in her hands and watched, fascinated, as it dissipated through her fingers.</p><p>I know we have a connection, Audrey. I know we do.</p><p>Audrey. She looked around her, up at the sky, at the other children in the sandbox, at her mother, a range of emotions crossing her tiny little face as the toddler slowly discovered the world around her.</p><p>&#x201c;Audrey.&#x201d; Saying the name aloud was dangerous. Someone might hear.</p><p>Don&#x2019;t dare get close. Her mother isn&#x2019;t far away. They&#x2019;ll know. They&#x2019;ll read it on my face, what I feel for you.</p><p>&#x201c;C&#x2019;mon, sweetheart.&#x201d; Her mother scooped her up in her arms. &#x201c;Sammy! Jason! Jason, get Sammy. C&#x2019;mon, guys.&#x201d; The boys, older by a few years, were over on the swing set. They jumped off the swings and landed with a flourish. The mother led the boys, still holding Audrey&#x2014;Audrey&#x2014;as she walked away.</p><p>I will follow you, Audrey. I will see you soon.</p><p>2</p><p><b>M</b>ARY CUTLER&#x2019;S HEAD jerked off the pillow. A mother&#x2019;s reflex. She&#x2019;d been a light sleeper since Sammy was born seven years ago. Probably some shift in the pressure in the house, some break in equilibrium, had stirred her. Probably that was all.</p><p>Her eyes drifted to the clock by the bed. It was ten past two. Frank must just be getting home, probably reeking of alcohol and cigarettes, maybe even perfume. A brief surge of rage penetrated her sleepy haze. She wondered if she would have the energy to raise the issue.</p><p>Her eyes closed again as she surrendered to exhaustion, one maternal ear open to external sounds as her face fit into a cool, comfortable space in a pillow, as her conscious mind spiraled away&#x2014;</p><p>Her eyes popped open. Her body stiffened. Something dark and uneasy filled her chest. Her legs slid out of the bed. She stepped past her slippers and moved across the carpet in her bare feet. An unknowing feeling of dread reached her throat as she moved down the hall and pushed the bedroom door open, where her boy, Sammy, slept over the covers of his bed.</p><p>She crossed the kitchen toward Audrey&#x2019;s bedroom and felt a breeze reach her. She picked up her pace to a jog. Before she saw the empty bed, with the covers pulled back, she saw the open window, a window that had been closed when she had put her daughter down hours ago.</p><p>She didn&#x2019;t hear herself scream.</p><p> * * *</p><p>AS HE NAVIGATED the corner in his sedan, Detective Vic Carruthers groaned. A small crowd of neighbors had already gathered around a squad car that had just pulled up outside the house. Was it idle curiosity surrounding the police presence? Or had word leaked out?</p><p>It had been five hours since two-year-old Audrey Cutler had been abducted from her home&#x2014;snatched out of her bed at two in the morning. An insomniac neighbor, three doors down, had seen someone running down the street from the Cutler house. <i>It looked like they were carrying something</i>, the neighbor had said, with a trace of after-the-fact apology.</p><p>The trail had gone cold. The description was next to nothing. Medium height, baseball cap&#x2014;best the neighbor could do from a distance of a football field, with the lighting weak at best. Nothing telltale from the scene. No fingerprints, no shoe prints, nothing.</p><p>Until they had run a check on prior offenders. Griffin Perlini, age twenty-eight, lived a quarter mile from the Cutler home. He had a kiddie sheet. And not just minors: He liked them young.</p><p>The arrests had been for sexual contact, but one had been dropped, the other convicted on the lesser charge of indecent exposure. Griffin Perlini had lured a four-year-old into the woods by a playground in a downstate town. The state had apparently decided it couldn&#x2019;t prove the sexual touching, but they convicted on eyewitness testimony that Perlini had been seen pulling up his pants as the witness approached him.</p><p>&#x201c;Got a feeling about this,&#x201d; Carruthers told his partner, Joe Gooden.</p><p>They got out at the curb. Carruthers nodded at the uniform who followed in step behind the senior officers. Carruthers did a once-over. It was a ranch, like many of the places on the block. Old place with vinyl siding. Cobblestone steps leading from the driveway to the small porch. The lawn had seen better times. No vehicle in the driveway. A one-car attached garage.</p><p>Only seven in the morning, but already sticky-hot. Gooden had a sheen across his forehead.</p><p>Carruthers rang the doorbell and stepped back, keeping an angle that allowed him to look for movement near the windows. It came quickly, a stirring of a curtain on the east side front.</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s got five seconds,&#x201d; Carruthers said. If his gut was right on this, he wasn&#x2019;t going to give Perlini time to dispose of evidence&#x2014;or a little girl.</p><p>He heard a small pop at the door&#x2014;the deadbolt releasing&#x2014;then a face that resembled a mug shot he&#x2019;d recently seen, staring at him through a torn screen door.</p><p>&#x201c;Mr. Perlini?&#x201d;</p><p>The man didn&#x2019;t answer.</p><p>&#x201c;Detective Carruthers. This is Detective Gooden.&#x201d;</p><p>Carruthers stopped there. Curious about the response he&#x2019;d get.</p><p>Perlini&#x2019;s eyes dropped. Pedophiles were like that. Wouldn&#x2019;t look adults in the eye.</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah?&#x201d; Perlini said.</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re looking for a little girl, Mr. Perlini. She wandered off from her house. We think she walked this way, and we were wondering if anyone took her in. Y&#x2019;know, to take care of her, until her parents showed.&#x201d;</p><p>The first order of business here was to get that little girl back home safe. Didn&#x2019;t matter how. He was giving Perlini an out, the opportunity to pretend that the child had simply wandered off, that Perlini had done what any good citizen might do. From Perlini&#x2019;s perspective, it was a way to stop this right now, with the possibility of avoiding a criminal charge.</p><p>Perlini didn&#x2019;t answer.</p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s real young,&#x201d; Carruthers elaborated. &#x201c;Probably too young to even say her name. So we figured, maybe someone was hanging on to her. To be safe.&#x201d;</p><p>It was going to work now or never. The suspect couldn&#x2019;t hesitate on the answer. Either he had her or he didn&#x2019;t. If he had her, and he was going to buy this out Carruthers was offering, he&#x2019;d have to purchase that ticket now.</p><p>&#x201c;I was just sleepin&#x2019;.&#x201d; Perlini scratched his head, gathered a bunch of his thick red hair in his hand.</p><p><i>Well, you answered the door pretty damn fast for being asleep.</i></p><p>&#x201c;How &#x2019;bout we step inside and talk a minute.&#x201d; Carruthers wasn&#x2019;t asking.</p><p>Perlini scratched his head again and looked back over his shoulder. He had a small frame. He was skinny and below-average height. The neighbor&#x2019;s description wasn&#x2019;t much, but it generally fit this guy.</p><p>&#x201c;What do ya say, Griffin? A quick talk.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Um&#x2014;well&#x2014;my lawyer is Reggie Lionel.&#x201d;</p><p><i>His lawyer.</i> Carruthers felt a rush.</p><p>Perlini pointed behind him. &#x201c;I could call him, but it&#x2019;s early&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Your lawyer needs his beauty sleep, Griffin.&#x201d; Carruthers grabbed the handle to the screen door, but it wouldn&#x2019;t move.</p><p>Perlini&#x2019;s eyes moved up to the detective&#x2019;s, reading pure fear.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll need to unlock this door, Griffin. Right now. <i>Right</i> now.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;O&#x2014;okay. Okay.&#x201d; He pushed the door open.</p><p>Carruthers took the door handle. &#x201c;Take two steps back, please.&#x201d;</p><p>Carruthers, Gooden, and the uniform stepped in. Perlini suddenly looked lost in his own house, unsure of what to do, where to stand or where to go. Carruthers thought he&#x2019;d let Perlini make the call. Surely, Perlini would try to direct them away from anything telltale.</p><p>The detective&#x2019;s pulse was racing. She might be here in the house. She might still be alive. Behind him, Detective Gooden was strolling casually beyond the foyer, looking for anything in plain view.</p><p>&#x201c;Is anyone else in this house, Griffin?&#x201d;</p><p>Perlini shook his head, no.</p><p>&#x201c;Griffin, you know a girl named Audrey Cutler?&#x201d;</p><p>Perlini&#x2019;s eyes were once again downcast, in anticipation of unwanted questioning, like a child expecting a scolding. On mention of the girl&#x2019;s name, his eyes froze. His posture stiffened.</p><p>The answer was yes.</p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Perlini said.</p><p>&#x201c;Griffin,&#x201d; Gooden called out, &#x201c;you don&#x2019;t mind I look around a little?&#x201d;</p><p>He did mind; it was all over his face. But pedophiles, they didn&#x2019;t have a spine, not with adults. It wasn&#x2019;t exactly textbook consent, but Perlini hadn&#x2019;t said no. Carruthers was pretty sure he&#x2019;d be able to reflect back on this moment and remember Perlini nodding his head.</p><p>&#x201c;Eyes up, Griffin. Look at me.&#x201d; Carruthers gestured to his own eyes, his fingers forked in a peace sign.</p><p>Perlini did the best he could, his eyes sweeping back and forth past Carruthers like a searchlight.</p><p>&#x201c;If there was a misunderstanding here, Griffin&#x2014;if maybe you thought about doing something but changed your mind&#x2014;hey, let&#x2019;s get that girl back home. No harm, no foul&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No. No.&#x201d; Perlini shook his head, the insolent child, and gripped his tomato-red hair in two fists.</p><p>Carruthers heard a noise outside. A voice, yelling. He looked through the door and saw a man pointing at the house, talking to a gathering crowd. Something about a child molester.</p><p>The detective turned back to Perlini, who was beginning to dissolve. He was shaking his head with a childlike fury, tears forming in his eyes.</p><p>&#x201c;This won&#x2019;t get any better, Griffin,&#x201d; Carruthers told him. &#x201c;Every minute you stiff-arm me, it gets worse.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;<i>Vic!&#x201d;</i></p><p>Gooden&#x2019;s voice sounded distant.</p><p>&#x201c;Take that seat over there, Griffin.&#x201d; He pointed to a small living room, a beat-up love seat with a torn cushion. He nodded to the officer, who clearly understood his direction to keep an eye on the suspect.</p><p>Carruthers moved quickly down a small tiled hallway, turned into a carpeted room with a television and fireplace, and found the back door to the place ajar. He stepped outside, into a yard of neglected grass and some old lawn furniture.</p><p>&#x201c;Vic!&#x201d;</p><p>His partner was calling from the detached garage behind the house. No&#x2014;it wasn&#x2019;t a garage at all, just a small coach house within the fenced property.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m here,&#x201d; Carruthers said, opening the door. &#x201c;Jesus Christ.&#x201d;</p><p>The room was filled with black-and-white photos on the walls and hung from clotheslines. Children. Toddlers. Dozens of them, looked to be ages two or three at best. Some of them were taken indoors&#x2014;maybe a shopping mall, probably the one a couple miles away. Most of them were photos from a park.</p><p>Gooden walked along one of the clotheslines and fingered a series of photos taken of a small girl in a sandbox. Carruthers had seen the face very recently. For confirmation he did not need...</p></p><h2>Daring to Drive: A Saudi Woman&#39;s Awakening</h2><p>&#x201c;A vital, inspiring book&#x201d; (<i>O</i>,<i> The Oprah Magazine</i>): a ferociously intimate memoir by a devout woman from a modest family in Saudi Arabia who became the unexpected leader of the courageous movement that won Saudi women the right to drive.<br><br>Manal al-Sharif grew up in Mecca the second daughter of a taxi driver, born the year strict fundamentalism took hold. In her adolescence, she was a religious radical, melting her brother&#x2019;s boy band cassettes in the oven because music was <i>haram</i>: forbidden by Islamic law. But what a difference an education can make. By her twenties Manal was a computer security engineer, one of few women working in a desert compound built to resemble suburban America. That&#x2019;s when the Saudi kingdom&#x2019;s contradictions became too much to bear: she was labeled a slut for chatting with male colleagues, her school-age brother chaperoned her on a business trip, and while she kept a car in the garage, she was forbidden from driving on Saudi streets.<br> <br>Manal al-Sharif&#x2019;s memoir is an &#x201c;eye-opening&#x201d; (<i>The Christian Science Monitor</i>) account of the making of an accidental activist, a vivid story of a young Muslim woman who stood up to a kingdom of men&#x2014;and won. <i>Daring to Drive</i> is &#x201c;a brave, extraordinary, heartbreakingly personal&#x201d; (Associated Press) celebration of resilience in the face of tyranny and &#x201c;a testament to how women in Muslim countries are helping change their culture, one step at a time&#x201d; (<i>New York Journal of Books</i>).</p><p>Manal al-Sharif is a women&#x2019;s rights activist from Saudi Arabia who was imprisoned in 2011 for driving a car. She has been lauded by&nbsp;<i>Foreign Policy</i>,&nbsp;<i>Time</i>,&nbsp;<i>Forbes</i>, and the Oslo Freedom Forum.&nbsp;<i>Daring to Drive</i>&nbsp;is her first book.Daring to Drive 1<p></p> A Country of One King and Millions of Queens<p></p> <br>The secret police came for me at two in the morning. The second knock on the door quickly followed the first. They were loud, hard knocks, the kind that radiate out and shake the doorframe. My five-year-old son was asleep, but I was awake still, sitting up with my brother.<br> <br>Startled, my brother jumped up and rushed to the entry. I stayed slightly behind, feeling the night air rush in as he pulled open the door. It was May, so the air was warm but still pleasant, not oppressively hot. And it was dark. My lone porch light had burned out weeks before and I hadn&#x2019;t bothered to replace it. I thought about the light, I wondered whether the sudden noise would have woken my son&#x2014;small thoughts passing through my mind in those seconds before everything changed.<br> <br>In the shadowy darkness, all we could see were men, crowding around my front stoop, pressing forward. They had no uniforms, nothing to identify them. When my brother asked them who they were, there was silence. Finally, one of them spoke. &#x201c;Is this Manal al-Sharif&#x2019;s house?&#x201d;<br> <br>My brother didn&#x2019;t hesitate. &#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; he answered, his voice firm.<br> <br>&#x201c;She needs to come with us right now. They want to see her at the Dhahran police station.&#x201d; My brother did not have to ask why. That previous afternoon I had been pulled over by the traffic police for the &#x201c;crime&#x201d; of driving my brother&#x2019;s car. The specific citation was &#x201c;driving while female.&#x201d; My brother had been sitting beside me, in the passenger seat, and then had sat next to me again for five hours inside the Thuqbah traffic police station, a two-story, nondescript concrete government building with a sturdy fence all around and a detention room where drivers could be held for hours or even days. There was only one detention space in the station, and it was only for men. I&#x2019;m quite sure that I was the first woman ever to enter the Thuqbah station. It took the police several hours, including a call to the commander and a visit to the local governor&#x2019;s house, just to produce a paper for me to sign. The paper was a promise to never again drive on Saudi lands. I refused to sign, but they persisted. When my brother read the piece of paper, he realized I would only be admitting to having violated Saudi custom, because there are no specific Saudi statutes or lines in the traffic code that forbid women from driving. All they could accuse me of was disobeying the orf, or custom. I signed, and we were released. My brother and I took a taxi home, thinking that the incident was over, thinking that we had stymied the system, that in some small way, we had won.<br> <br>We returned to my town house to find the TV on. There were pizza boxes on the coffee table, and three of my friends were clustered in my small living room with their laptops and smartphones. As I walked in, my sister-in-law started crying, and my friends rushed over and hugged me, shouting that they couldn&#x2019;t believe the police had let me go. One friend had even started a Twitter hashtag, #FreeManal, after I&#x2019;d texted him from the car when the police first pulled me over. Everyone was talking at once, telling me to look at this tweet or that Facebook page or this news feed. In the six hours, the news of my arrest had gone viral. But I couldn&#x2019;t look at anything. I was exhausted, physically, mentally, and emotionally. All I wanted to do was to take a shower and go to bed. But it is against every Saudi custom to ask guests to leave, so I sat and we talked about winning our first battle, about having proved that there is no traffic code explicitly banning women from driving. When they finally left, they were still so excited and happy&#x2014;and so was I, thinking, Well, now no one can stop us.<br> <br>But then it was 2:00 a.m. and there were men at my door and my elation from the day was gone. As soon as I heard the words &#x201c;Dhahran police station,&#x201d; I was terrified. My brother slammed the door shut and locked the bolt. There was a pause. Then the knocking started again.<br> <br><br> <br>My town house was not in the holy city of Mecca, my childhood home of twisted streets and thronging pilgrims, off-limits to all non-Muslims. Nor was it set amid the gleaming towers and sky bridges of the Saudi Arabian capital of Riyadh, high on a desert plateau. It was tucked in perhaps the most Western enclave in the entire kingdom, the pristine Aramco (Saudi Arabian Oil Company) compound in the Eastern Province, originally designed by Americans working for John D. Rockefeller&#x2019;s company, Standard Oil, which had helped found Aramco. Today, Aramco is the Saudi state oil company and the world&#x2019;s largest daily exporter of oil, sitting atop 260 billion barrels of petroleum reserves. It is also the world&#x2019;s wealthiest company, with a net worth estimated as high as $2.5 trillion. And it was my employer. When the Americans sold Aramco to the Saudis in the 1970s and 1980s, part of the agreement required the Saudis to continue to employ women.<br> <br>The Aramco compound has long been a world unto itself. With lush green golf courses, lawns, palm trees, parks, and swimming pools, it looks very much like a perfect Southern California town. Inside the gates of Aramco, Saudi rules do not apply. Men and women mix together. Women do not have to be veiled or covered. We celebrated holidays like Halloween, when everyone dresses up in costumes. And unlike every other place in Saudi Arabia, inside the Aramco compound, women can drive. There are no prohibitions, no restrictions. They simply slip behind the wheel and start the engine. And there are protections. Not even the local city police or the Saudi religious police are allowed to venture onto Aramco-controlled land. Aramco has its own security and fire departments. It handles its matters internally, like a separate, sovereign state inside the Saudi kingdom.<br> <br>But the Saudi secret police, I learned that night, could still enter.<br> <br>I turned to face the sliding glass doors at the edge of my living room. Unlike the traditional Saudi way of covering one&#x2019;s house the way most families cover their women, I have never liked curtains. I always wanted the light streaming in. Now one of the men stood with his face pressed against the bare glass, his damp breath spreading like fog before the dry desert air sucked it back up again. He said nothing, and he did not move. Only his eyes slowly scanned my room. That night, he did not move from that glass door, did not release his face the entire time. Like the others, he was dressed in civilian clothes. That, however, is the hallmark of the secret police. They do not wear uniforms. They do not even identify themselves as police. They have other jobs, other identities. Yet they are woven through society at every level, and their sole purpose is to inform. They are employed by the kingdom to monitor citizens and to enforce the rules.<br> <br>From behind the door, my brother began pushing back. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you realize it&#x2019;s two in the morning? People are asleep here. Besides, we&#x2019;ve only just come from the Thuqbah traffic police station.&#x201d; He wanted to imply that the matter had already been resolved. But there was no reply.<br> <br>My brother paused and then raised his voice a little louder. &#x201c;Who are you people? Unless you have an arrest warrant, we won&#x2019;t leave. If you want something, come back in the morning. You don&#x2019;t show up in the middle of the night and talk about bringing us to the police.&#x201d;<br> <br>This was an understatement. In Saudi Arabia, our legal code is referred to not as &#x201c;laws,&#x201d; which devout Saudi Muslims believe can be given only by Allah; we use another word that translates into English roughly as &#x201c;system.&#x201d; The system says that no one can be arrested for a minor crime between the hours of sunset and sunrise. The same system also says that you cannot arrest anyone without a statement from a judge, unless the authorities consider you a threat to national security. But the men outside said nothing. After a few minutes had passed, they started knocking again.<br> <br>I was standing now in my living room, wearing sweatpants and a Mickey Mouse T-shirt. I had nowhere else to go. It was a small house: a living room, a tiny galley kitchen, one bedroom, and a balcony, all of 750 square feet. Enough for my five-year-old son and me. I was divorced; under Saudi rules, without a husband, my father was my official male guardian. I could not work, attend school, or travel without his permission. But he lived in Jeddah, on the other side of the country.<br> <br>I didn&#x2019;t know if the men could force open the door and come in and take me. I still didn&#x2019;t even know exactly who &#x201c;they&#x201d; were, but I realized I had to tell someone what was happening. I dialed a female Saudi journalist. I&#x2019;d reached out to her when I&#x2019;d first become interested in proving that women could legally drive. Even though it was the middle of the night, she answered the phone and told me she&#x2019;d get me a lawyer. She gave me the number the lawyer would be calling me from. A few minutes later my phone rang. A woman named Suad al-Shammari, who identified herself as a lawyer, was on the line. The first thing she told me was to record our phone call, so I recorded the call with my iPhone as we spoke.<br> <br>&#x201c;Who are they?&#x201d; she asked. &#x201c;Are they religious police? Representatives from the traffic police? Do they have any kind of warrant?&#x201d;<br> <br>I told her that I didn&#x2019;t know. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re still outside knocking,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>Suad talked with me for nearly twenty minutes. She told me that unless these men were from the national security division and I was wanted as a terrorist, they weren&#x2019;t allowed to come in the middle of the night and tell me to leave my home. She suggested I call the local police and ask if a warrant had been issued for my arrest. If there was no warrant, I should not go with them. &#x201c;Send them away,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t leave with them.&#x201d; So, as I listened to the men rapping their fists against my front door, I dialed 999 to speak with the police. A man on the other end of the line assured me there was no warrant for my arrest.<br> <br>Almost as soon as I hung up, my phone rang again. This call was from Kholoud, a women&#x2019;s rights activist, who had already been tweeting about my arrest the previous afternoon. In the confusion, I didn&#x2019;t know that at that very moment one of my colleagues from Aramco, Omar al-Johani, was hiding behind a bush very close to my house. He had read Kholoud&#x2019;s tweets about my arrest and knew the street where I lived. He drove around until he saw the cars and the security guards. Now he was tweeting about the men surrounding my door. Kholoud was following him online. &#x201c;Manal,&#x201d; she said calmly, &#x201c;I want you to do something. I want you to go with these guys. It will bring them shame if we announce that they&#x2019;ve taken you from your house in the middle of the night. This is a violation of your rights. We should expose them.&#x201d;<br> <br>I didn&#x2019;t like the idea of going anywhere with these people. I didn&#x2019;t want to leave my son and I still didn&#x2019;t know exactly who was outside. But I kept thinking about what Kholoud had said. I decided to pray. I went upstairs. In the hallway leading to my small bedroom. I performed two raka&#x2019;as (the full cycle of an Islamic prayer, spoken while standing, sitting, and prostrating) and asked for God to show me the way. It was now nearly four in the morning. In a little over an hour the sky would be streaked with the first hint of desert sun. I felt something inside me say, &#x201c;Go, Manal. You&#x2019;ll be okay.&#x201d;<br> <br>I composed myself, walked downstairs, and opened the door. Not everyone outside was a stranger. I recognized one man, Fahad, as an Aramco official; he held up his company ID card as proof. He started speaking to me but the whole time his eyes and his face were turned away, so that he was looking only at my brother. &#x201c;We just need you to come to the Dhahran police station,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll sign some papers and then be released. I am a colleague, so you can trust me. I will be there with you, I will not leave you. I will bring you back.&#x201d;<br> <br>I didn&#x2019;t trust him. I called Aramco security. The man on the other end assured me, &#x201c;This guy works for us. He will escort you to the police station.&#x201d; My brother insisted upon accompanying me as well, although all the men outside wanted me to go alone, without him, which should have convinced me that something was wrong. In Saudi society, a woman needs her official guardian (usually her father or husband) or a mahram&#x2014;a close male family relative whom she cannot marry, such as a father, brother, uncle, or even a son&#x2014;to accompany her on any official business.<br> <br>Even a woman in labor will not be admitted into a hospital without her guardian or at least a mahram. Police cannot enter a home during a robbery, and firefighters are forbidden from entering a home during a fire or medical emergency if a woman is inside but does not have a mahram present. In 2014, Amna Bawazeer died on the campus of King Saud University when school officials refused to allow male paramedics to enter the female-only school after Amna collapsed from a heart ailment. The same story repeated itself in 2016 at Qaseem University when male paramedics were not allowed on campus to treat a female student, Dhuha Almane, who subsequently died. It is not a stretch to say that death is preferable to violating the strict code of guardianship and mahrams.<br> <br>I went back inside and put on my abaya, the swirling black cloak that covered my entire body, except for my hands and the tips of my feet, as well as a hijab, a head scarf, that covered my hair, my ears, and my neck, everything except my face. Then I made one last phone call to Atika Shubert, a female reporter for CNN based in London, who had interviewed me a week earlier. Atika promised that she&#x2019;d put the news that I&#x2019;d been taken from my home on CNN&#x2019;s international website. If she did that, I trusted that I would not simply disappear.<br> <br>I walked out holding my brother&#x2019;s arm, I hadn&#x2019;t even looked at my sleeping little boy or kissed him goodbye. I wanted to believe that this was a formality, that I&#x2019;d be back in time to wake him, feed him breakfast, get him to school, and then head to work. At most, I told myself, I would only be gone a couple of hours. At this time of night, it was less than ten minutes from the Aramco compound to the Dhahran police station.<br> <br>As soon as I stepped outside I counted the people there. There were nine of them: seven men, two women, and five cars. Once I passed through the doorway, the two women&#x2014;female Aramco guards, fully covered except for a small slit for their eyes&#x2014;muscled in beside me. I knew they worked for Aramco because over their abayas they were wearing the company&#x2019;s standard issue khaki-colored coats with a large badge on the chest. They were most likely part of the contingent of female guards who manned the checkpoint at the women&#x2019;s gate into the compound. When veiled women entered Aramco, these guards were the ones who uncovered their faces to verify the women&#x2019;s identities. They could gaze upon any other woman&#x2019;s face, know her identity, without ever revealing their own.<br> <br>They walked uncomfortably close, as if they were ready to grab me and hold me down if I tried to escape. I got into the back of one of the cars&#x2014;not a police car but an Aramco company car. The women didn&#x2019;t follow me in. I was alone, except for two men. My brother sat in the front, and Fahad, the Aramco official, drove. No one spoke. I looked out the window at the blackness, felt the car hum along the road....</p><h2>Pok�mon Adventures: Diamond and Pearl/Platinum, Vol. 10 (10)</h2><p>Awesome adventures inspired by the best-selling Pok�mon Diamond and Pearl and Pok�mon Platinum video games!<br><br>All your favorite Pok�mon game characters jump out of the screen into the pages of this action-packed manga!<br><br> Finally together again, Dia, Pearl, and Platinum must battle Legendary Pok�mon Dialga and Palkia, who are being controlled by Cyrus, the powerful boss of Team Galactic!

Though Mr. Bouchait &#x2014; a master cheesemaker based in southwest France &#x2014; focuses on the 45 French cheeses that have government-controlled names, his broad scope includes types of milk, raw and pasteurized cheeses, ripening, storage, fat content, wine pairings (he prefers white) and 40 recipes." &#x2014;NEW YORK TIMES</p><h2>ADHD and Me: What I Learned from Lighting Fires at the Dinner Table</h2><p><p>Blake Taylor's mother first suspected he had ADHD when he, at only three years of age, tried to push his infant sister in her carrier off the kitchen table.

It has everything&#x2014;a green cover, a nice spine, and pages that turn from right to left (or left to right if you're adventurous.) But what they can't agree upon is who owns it! When their favorite book ends up snatched by a bookworm, Bloo and Redd must work together to write their own book to get it back. Playing with the "meta-picture book" subgenre, Long and Foster have added a funny and fresh story with several teachable moments. On the surface it's a simple tale about sharing and the joy of reading, but with Redd describing the different components of a book, and the two then using that information to create their own volume, this is a wonderful teaching tool for either a creative writing or an introductory language arts lesson. The two characters play off of each other well, and the large dialogue balloons matched with the cartoonish character design with no background scenery will please the many fans of "Elephant and Piggie."

The Society is entirely free from educational, political, or ecclesiastical control. Dedicated to an idealistic approach to the solution of human problems, the Society&#39;s program stresses the need for the integration of religion, philosophy, and the science of psychology into one system of instruction. The goal of this instruction is to enable the individual to develop a mature philosophy of life, to recognize his proper responsibilities and opportunities, and to understand and appreciate his place in the unfolding universal pattern.Manly P. Hall was the founder of the Philosophical Research Society. In over seventy-five years of dynamic public activity, he delivered more than 8,000 lectures in the United States and abroad, and authored countless books, essays, and articles. In his lectures and writings, Manly Hall always emphasized the practical aspects of philosophy and religion as they applied to daily living. He restated for modern man those spiritual and ethical doctrines which have given humanity its noblest ideals and most adequate codes of conduct. Believing that philosophy is a working tool to help the individual in building a solid foundation for his dreams and purposes, Manly Hall steadfastly sought recognition of the belief that world civilization can be perfected only when human beings meet on a common ground of intelligence, cooperation, and worthy purpose.</p><h2>Ablaze for God</h2><p><p>What are the spiritual dynamics of leadership?

The rain had passed, but it remained cool enough to justify CII operative Wormwood's light tan raincoat. His taste ran more to trench coats, but he dared not wear one, knowing his fellow agents would scoff. Wormwood compromised by turning the collar of his raincoat up and plunging his hands deep into his pockets. One of these hands was clenched around a piece of bubble gum he had received only twenty minutes before from an evil-smelling gnome on the forbidding grounds of Ste. Justine hospital. The gnome had stepped out suddenly from the bushes, giving Wormwood a dreadful start, which he had tried to convert into a gesture of Oriental defense. The image of feline alertness might have been more effective if he had not had the misfortune to back into a rosebush.<br><br>Wormwood's step was crisp along the emptying street. He felt uplifted by a sense&#x2014;not of greatness, to be sure&#x2014;but of adequacy. For once he had not muddled the job. His reflection rippled along a dark shop window, and he was not displeased with what he saw. The confident glance and determined stride more than compensated for the sloping shoulders and balding head. Wormwood twisted his palms outward to correct his shoulder slump because someone once told him that the best way to achieve manly posture was to walk with the palms forward. It was most uncomfortable, and it made him walk rather like a penguin, but he did it whenever he thought of it.<br>He was painfully reminded of his recent encounter with the rosebush, but he discovered that he could relieve his discomfort by nipping the seam of his pants between thumb and forefinger and tugging it away from his buttocks. And this he did from time to time, ignoring the open curiosity of passersby.<br><br>He was content. "It's got to be a matter of confidence," he told himself. "I knew I could pull this off, and I pulled it off!" He treasured a theory that one attracted bad luck by anticipating it, and the results of his last several assignments seemed to lend support to the concept. In general, theories did not hold up for Wormwood. To his problem of balding, he had applied the principle of Keep It Short and You'll Keep It Long, and he always wore a crew cut that made him appear less significant than necessary, but his hair continued to fall. For a while, he had clung to the theory that early balding indicated uncommon virility, but personal experience eventually forced him to abandon this hypothesis.<br><br>"This time I'm home free, and no screw-up. Six o'clock tomorrow morning I'll be back in the States!"<br><br>His fist tightened down on the bubble gum. He could not afford another failure. The men at home base were already referring to him as the "one-man Bay of Pigs."<br><br>As he turned left into Lessage Lane, the street seemed empty of sound and people. He took note of this. By the time he had turned south again on St. Dominique, it was so silent that the sound of his footfalls seemed to clip back at him from the facades of unlit, dreary brick buildings. The silence did not disturb him; he whistled as a matter of choice.<br><br>"This think-positive bit really scores," he thought jazzily. "Winners win, and that's a fact." Then his round boyish face contracted into concern as he wondered if it was also true that losers lose. He tried to remember his college logic course. <br>"No," he decided at length, "that doesn't necessarily follow. Losers don't always lose. But winners always win!" He felt better for having thought it out.<br><br>He was only one block from his third-rate hotel. He could see the damaged sign H TEL in vertical red neon down the street.<br><br>"Almost home free."<br><br>He recalled CII Training Center instructions always to approach your destination from the opposite side of the street, so he crossed over. He had never fully understood the reason for this rule, beyond simple sneakiness, but it would no more occur to him to demand an explanation than it would to disobey.<br><br>St. Dominique's wrought iron streetlamps had not yet fallen prey to urban uglification in the form of lip-blacking mercury lamps, so Wormwood was able to amuse himself by watching his shadow slip out from beneath his feet and grow long before him, until the next lamp assumed domination and projected his shadow, ever shortening, behind him. He was looking over his shoulder, admiring this photic phenomenon, when he ran into the lamppost. Upon recovery, he glanced angrily up and down the street, mentally daring anyone to have seen.<br><br>Someone had seen, but Wormwood did not know this, so he glared at the offending lamppost, straightened his shoulders by twisting his palms forward, and crossed to his hotel.<br><br>The hall was reassuringly redolent of that medley of mildew, Lysol, and urine characteristic of run-down hotels. According to subsequent reports, Wormwood must have entered the hotel between 11:55 and 11:57. Whatever the exact time, we may be sure he checked it, delighting as always in the luminosity of his watch's dial. He had heard that the phosphorescent material used on watch dials could cause skin cancer, but he felt that he made up for the risk by not smoking. He had developed the habit of checking the time whenever he found himself in a dark place. Otherwise, what was the use of having a watch with a luminous dial? It was probably the time he spent considering this that made the difference between 11:55 and 11:57.<br><br>As he climbed the dimly lit staircase with its damp, scrofulous carpet, he reminded himself that "winners win." His spirits sank, however, when he heard the sound of coughing from the room next to his. It was a racking, gagging, disease-laden cough that went on in spasms throughout the night. He had never seen the old man next door, but he hated the cough that kept him awake.<br><br>Standing outside his door, he took the bubble gum from his pocket and examined it. "Probably microfilm. And it's probably between the gum and the paper. Where the funnies usually are."<br><br>His key turned the slack lock. As he closed the door behind himself, he breathed with relief. "There's no getting around it," he admitted. "Winners&#x2014;"<br><br>But the thought choked in mid-conception. He was not alone in the room.<br><br>With a reaction the Training Center would have applauded, he popped the bubble gum, wrapper and all, into his mouth and swallowed it just as the back of his skull was crushed in. The pain was very sharp indeed, but the sound was more terrible. It was akin to biting into crisp celery with your hands over your ears&#x2014;but more intimate.<br><br>He heard the sound of the second blow quite clearly&#x2014;a liquid crunch&#x2014;-but oddly it did not hurt.<br><br>Then something did hurt. He could not see, but he knew they were cutting open his throat. The image of it made him shudder, and he hoped he wouldn't be sick. Then they began on his stomach. Something cold rippled in and out of his stomach. The old man next door coughed and gagged. Wormwood's mind chased the thought that had been arrested by his first fright.<br><br>"Winners win," he thought, then he died.</p><h2>A Debt Against the Living: An Introduction to Originalism</h2><p>Thomas Jefferson famously wrote that the earth belongs to the living. His letter to James Madison is often quoted for the proposition that we should not be bound to the &#39;dead hand of the past&#39;, suggesting that the Constitution should instead be interpreted as a living, breathing document. Less well-known is Madison&#39;s response, in which he said the improvements made by the dead - including the US Constitution - form a debt against the living, who benefit from them. In this illuminating book, Ilan Wurman introduces Madison&#39;s concept of originalism to a new generation and shows how it has shaped the US Supreme Court in ways that are expected to continue following the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, one of the theory&#39;s leading proponents. It should be read by anyone seeking a better understanding of originalism and its ongoing influence on the constitutional jurisprudence of the Supreme Court.</p><p>This book is an introduction to and defense of originalism and the Founding intended for a more general audience. No similar book exists. It is aimed at law students, advanced college students, policymakers, and the politically interested reader seeking a general introduction to originalism and its implications for today.Ilan Wurman is an attorney in Washington, DC, and a nonresident fellow at the Stanford Constitutional Law Center. He was formerly deputy general counsel on Senator Rand Paul&#39;s US presidential campaign, associate counsel on Senator Tom Cotton&#39;s campaign for US Senate, and a law clerk to the honorable Jerry E. Smith of the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. His writing has appeared or is forthcoming in numerous law reviews, including the Stanford Law Review and the Texas Law Review, as well as in national journals, including National Affairs, The Weekly Standard, and City Journal. He graduated from Stanford Law School, and from Claremont McKenna College with degrees in Government and Physics.</p><h2>Legal Writing by Design: A Guide to Great Briefs and Memos</h2><p>The second edition of <i>Legal Writing by Design</i> remains unique in demonstrating how to transform thoughts into writing by explaining the link between thinking and writing. It doesn't just tell the reader to ''argue by analogy'' or to ''apply the rule'' &#x2014; it explains the design of the thinking involved in those processes and shows how to transform that design into writing.<br><br>Through easily understandable hypotheticals, outlines, graphics, exercises, and writing samples, many garnered during the authors' combined forty-plus years of teaching legal writing and appellate advocacy to law students, <i>Legal Writing by Design</i> comprehensively demonstrates how to transform ideas into exceptional writing. It demystifies the writing process by explaining the design of (1) deductive and inductive reasoning, (2) analogical thinking, and (3) relevancy. Once that design is understood, writing becomes easy.<br><br>Writing with liberal doses of humor, the authors provide clearly readable charts, examples, and templates throughout this second edition. All chapters include a chapter review, and many also provide writing prompts. In addition to chapters explaining the fundamentals of writing legal memos and briefs, <i>Legal Writing by Design</i> contains sections on (1) clear and effective writing; (2) the appellate process, including an easily understandable explanation of standards of review; (3) oral argument techniques and practice; (4) the writing and editing process; (5) case briefing; and (6) professionalism in the practice of law. Exercises corresponding to the principles explained are included throughout most chapters.<br><br>Successfully used for over ten years by thousands of law school students, <i>Legal Writing by Design</i> is the perfect tool for anyone &#x2014; attorneys, legal assistants, pro se litigants, undergraduate students, or the public &#x2014; who seeks the ideal way to analyze issues, to write clearly, and to write persuasively.<br></p><p>Teresa Reid Rambo is a Senior Legal Skills Professor at University of Florida Levin College of Law.

For most of these years Bernard Evans has taught graduate students. Lately he also teaches lay Catholics engaged in parish ministry and enrolled in diocesan ministry formation programs. This book is written specifically for the latter group. Evans agrees with the bishops of the United States who insist that any Catholic education that does not include Catholic social teaching is not fully Catholic. And so he writes clearly, concisely, and convincingly about how Catholic social teaching addresses such contemporary issues as human dignity, abortion, assisted suicide and euthanasia, embryonic stem cell research, the death penalty, war, family, marriage, poverty, superfluous income, just wages, unions, peace, solidarity, and many more. Excerpts from the church&#x2019;s official teachings in papal documents abound throughout the book.</p><p>Bernard F. Evans holds the Virgil Michel Ecumenical Chair in Rural Social Ministries at Saint John's School of Theology Seminary, Collegeville, Minnesota. A frequent speaker in parishes on the topic of biblical stewardship, he holds a PhD from Catholic University of America.

Certainly we Lutherans have much to learn from his illuminating depiction of the living tradition of Catholic social thought and its challenges to our own approaches and conclusions. Together we have much to say to one another as we learn to act together in the name of Christ and for the sake of a suffering and unjust world. Let the conversation begin in every community where we share moral responsibility. God grant that our mutual conversation may lead to more loving and faithful service of our neighbors and the achievement of greater human justice and freedom.<i>Trinity Seminary Review</i><br><br>While the compilation by itself is valuable to students, the inclusion of discussion questions and recommended actions that conclude the chapters on each of the topics provides readers with the inspiration to practice what has been preached.

But twenty years later, Crowley&#x2019;s name and image were everywhere. The Beatles put him on the cover of&nbsp; <i>Sgt. Pepper&#x2019;s Lonely Hearts Club Band</i>. The Rolling Stones were briefly serious devotees. Today, his visage hangs in goth clubs, occult temples, and college dorm rooms, and his methods of ceremonial magick animate the passions of myriad occultists and spiritual seekers.<br><br><b><i>Aleister Crowley</i></b> is more than just a biography of this compelling, controversial, and divisive figure&#x2014;it&#x2019;s also a portrait of his unparalleled influence on modern pop culture.</p><p><b>Gary Lachman</b> is one of today&#x2019;s most respected writers on esoteric and occult themes.

A founding member of Blondie, Lachman has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. He lives in London.&#x201c;Clocking in at 394 pages jam-packed with in-depth information, factoids, anecdotes and insights from the first sentence to the last. A historical biography through and through, Lachman&#x2019;s book is meticulously researched and it is quite easy to believe that the author, like a professor well-versed in their subject, could analyze and extrapolate at much greater lengths. The oft touted declaration of Crowley as the Wickedest Man in the World, may well have been overblown in it&#x2019;s own time, but he&#x2019;s certainly not an individual with whom it is easy to empathize.

Using a cryptic computer equation and magnetic fields to &#x201c;fold&#x201d; dimensions, it shrinks distances so that a traveler can travel hundreds of feet with a single step. <br><br>The invention promises to make mankind&#x2019;s dreams of teleportation a reality. And, the scientists insist, traveling through the Door is completely safe. Yet evidence is mounting that this miraculous machine isn&#x2019;t quite what it seems&#x2014;and that its creators are harboring a dangerous secret. As his investigations draw him deeper into the puzzle, Mike begins to fear there&#x2019;s only one answer that makes sense. And if he&#x2019;s right, it may only be a matter of time before the project destroys...everything. &nbsp;<br><br>A cunningly inventive mystery featuring a hero worthy of Sherlock Holmes and a terrifying final twist you&#x2019;ll never see coming,<i> The Fold</i> is that rarest of things: a genuinely page-turning science-fiction thriller.</p><p>PETER CLINES has published several pieces of short fiction and countless articles on the film and television industries.

"It doesn't do anything for me."<br><br> Becky bit back a smile, even though Denise couldn't see it over the&nbsp;phone. They'd had this conversation every other week for two months now. It still made for a good distraction, though, and helped fill up the time until Ben got home.<br><br> It always worried &nbsp;her a bit when Ben was away. Ben was in charge of high-security projects. Mostly weapons. Often in high-risk areas.&nbsp;<br><br>Granted, this had been one of the lowest-risk work trips he'd ever&nbsp;taken. Just four days in San Diego. And on a non-weapons project.<br><br>"I mean , Marty really likes it," Denise continued, "but it just seems like nothing but boobs and snow and blood. And the frozen zombie things. I just don't get them. It feels like not a lot ever actually happens, y'know7 Five years and they're still talking about winter."<br><br>Becky gathered up some socks, underwear, two T-shirts, a skirt, and&nbsp;a bra that had been scattered across the bedroom floor. She was a horri�ble slob whenever she had the house to herself. Worse than she'd been in college, for some reason she couldn't &nbsp;figure out. "So why do you keep watching it?"<br><br> "Ehh. Marty really likes it. He won't admit it, but I just think he likes all the boobs. Are you guys still watching?"<br><br> She walked to the bathroom , and shoved the armload of clothes into the hamper. The bathroom was a mess, &nbsp;too. &nbsp;Her yoga clothes and more underwear. &nbsp;How had she gone through so much &nbsp;underwear in four&nbsp;days? &#x201c;We&#x2019;re a couple episodes behind, but yeah,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I think he likes the boobs, too. And the dragons.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br> Becky put her foot in the trash can and mashed down the small pile of bathroom trash, just enough so it didn&#x2019;t look like it was overflowing. &#x201c;We were talking about doing a DVR marathon &nbsp;this weekend. Some- thing to relax a bit after his trip.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;When&#x2019;s he get back?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;His plane landed a little while ago,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;He sent me a text saying he had to stop at the office and give a quick report to his boss. Probably be home any minute now.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Cleaning up your mess?&#x201d;<br><br> She laughed. &#x201c;You know me too well.&#x201d; &#x201c;I should let you go, then.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Yeah, probably.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Give me a call next week,&#x201d; Denise said. &#x201c;Maybe we can all do dinner at that new Japanese place.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Okay.&#x201d;<br><br> She hung up and tossed the phone on the bed. She looked around and tried to spot anything else he could tease her for leaving out. There was a wineglass on her nightstand, and a plate with a few cheesecake crumbs. And another wineglass on her dresser. God, she was a slob. And a lush.<br> It crossed her mind now and then that she should try to be one of the good wives. The ones who kept the house clean, and had dinner wait- ing for her husband when he came home. When they&#x2019;d met, she&#x2019;d actually been dressed as a 1950s housewife at a Halloween party, complete with martini glass, apron, and a copy of an old&nbsp;<i>Good Housekeeping&nbsp;</i>list of duties she was supposed to perform. He&#x2019;d laughed, said she didn&#x2019;t look like the kind of woman who sat around &nbsp;waiting on a husband, and &nbsp;bought &nbsp;her a drink. &nbsp;They&#x2019;d &nbsp;ended &nbsp;Halloween night with a few things that were not covered in the&nbsp;<i>Good Housekeeping&nbsp;</i>article. Fourteen months later they were married.<br><br> She gathered up the glasses and the plate. She could swing by her art studio in the back and grab the dishes there. There was definitely a plate next to her computer from today&#x2019;s lunch, possibly a wineglass from last night. She could rinse them in the sink, maybe.<br><br>As she reached the studio door, a faint rasp of sliding metal echoed&nbsp;from the front of the house. A key in a lock. There was a click, and then the hinge squeaked. They&#x2019;d been trying to fix that damned thing for years.&nbsp;<br><br> The front door.<br><br> &#x201c;Hey, babe,&#x201d; she called out, setting all the dishes down on the desk. &#x201c;How was your flight?&#x201d; Ah, well. He wouldn&#x2019;t notice them right away in the studio. And it wasn&#x2019;t like he didn&#x2019;t know her by now. She took a few steps toward the hall, then decided to take the back staircase. It was closer, and she&#x2019;d probably meet him in the kitchen.<br><br> Something tickled her brain as her foot hit the first step. The lack of something. The usual chain of sounds she heard when Ben got home had been broken. She hadn&#x2019;t heard the hinge squeak again, or the door close. Or his keys hitting the table in the front hall.<br><br> &#x201c;Babe?&#x201d;<br><br> She lifted her foot from the step and walked back down the hall. From the top of the staircase she could see their front door. It sat open by almost a foot. She could smell the lawn outside and hear the traffic heading for the beltway.<br><br> Ben wasn&#x2019;t there. She didn&#x2019;t see his keys on the table. His briefcase wasn&#x2019;t shoved under the table where he always tossed it.<br><br> Becky took a few steps down the stairs. She peered over the banister to see if he was lurking in the hall. It wouldn&#x2019;t be the first time he&#x2019;d leaped out to scare her.<br><br> The hallway was empty.<br><br> She walked downstairs to the front door. It hung open in a relaxed, casual way. The same way it did when she was heading out to grab the mail or to growl at Pat from down the street for letting her dog crap on their lawn.<br><br> Had she left the door open when she went out for the mail earlier? Maybe just enough for the wind to push it open? Had she imagined the sound of the key? Ben was due home any minute. She might&#x2019;ve just heard the hinge squeak and added everything else.<br><br> She leaned out the door. It was cool. This late in the afternoon, the front of the house was in the shade.<br><br> Ben&#x2019;s car was in the driveway. It was right where it always landed, in front of the nearer garage door. She could see a faint shimmer of heat above the hood.&nbsp;<br><br> Becky pushed the door shut. The hinges squeaked. The latch clicked.&nbsp;<br><br> &#x201c;Are you in here, babe?&#x201d;<br><br> Floorboards settled. The air in the house shifted. Someone was in the kitchen. She recognized the creak of the tiles near the dishwasher. &#x201c;Ben?&#x201d; His name echoed in the house. She took a few strides toward&nbsp;the back of the house. &#x201c;Where are you?&#x201d;<br><br> The silence slowed her down, then brought her to a stop. &#x201c;If this is supposed to be funny, it&#x2019;s not.&#x201d;<br><br> Nothing.<br><br> She weighed her options. There was still a chance this was a trick. A joke gone bad. Ben would leap out and make her shriek and she&#x2019;d hit him and then welcome him home.<br><br>It didn&#x2019;t feel like a trick. The house felt wrong. Ben&#x2019;s car might be in the driveway, but there was a stranger moving through their home.<br><br> They owned a gun. A Glock 17 or 19 or something. She&#x2019;d taken four classes and gone shooting at the range three times. It was a badass, se- cret agent&#x2013;level gun. That&#x2019;s what Ben had said. They&#x2019;d probably never need it, but better to have it and not need it than need it and not . . .<br> The Glock was upstairs. In their bedroom. &nbsp;In the nightstand. &nbsp;She could take six long steps back and be at the main staircase.<br><br> Or take three steps forward and get a view into the kitchen.&nbsp;<br><br> She took two steps forward.<br><br> Ben&#x2019;s briefcase and travel bag sat in the hallway. It was a beat-up, gym bag sort of thing he&#x2019;d had for years. He still used it because it held three or four days&#x2019; worth of clothes, but it fit in an overhead compart- ment. Cut half an hour off his travel time to not be waiting on luggage.<br> &#x201c;Babe, I swear to God, I&#x2019;m calling the fucking cops in two minutes.&#x201d;<br><br> Her voice echoed in the house. &#x201c;This isn&#x2019;t funny.&#x201d;<br><br> A long groan sounded &nbsp;above her. The noise of stressed wood. The spot by her studio, close to the door. Neither of them had stepped on it in over a year because it was so damned loud.<br> Whoever was upstairs had stepped on it.&nbsp;<br><br> They were&nbsp;<i>upstairs</i>!<br><br> She looked up &nbsp;at the ceiling. Three seconds passed, and&nbsp; another board squeaked. She could almost see the footsteps through the plas- ter. Someone was circling around &nbsp;the house. Straight through &nbsp;to the&nbsp;kitchen, up the back staircase she&#x2019;d had her foot on just five minutes ago, and into the upstairs hallway. They were near the bedroom.&nbsp;<br><br> Near the gun.<br><br> Jesus, why hadn&#x2019;t she grabbed the gun as soon as things got weird? But why was Ben&#x2019;s &nbsp;luggage in the house? Why was his car in the&nbsp;driveway? Had someone grabbed him at the airport? Did he get car- jacked?<br><br> There was a panic number she was supposed to call. In case some- thing happened &nbsp;to him, if someone tried to get to him through &nbsp;her. He&#x2019;d given it to her, and she&#x2019;d never even put it in her phone.<br><br> It was in the desk in her studio. Of course.<br><br> Becky stepped into the kitchen and grabbed her cell phone from the counter. Then she grabbed a knife from the big block. A wedding present from one of Ben&#x2019;s old college friends. It was a great set. The blade of the butcher knife was almost fourteen inches long and sharp as hell. And the handle sat well in her hand.<br><br> They&#x2019;d all laughed at the idea that knives were a bad-luck wedding gift.<br><br> She slid her fingers over the phone&#x2019;s screen and tapped in 911. She held off pressing call. &nbsp;There was still a chance this was a bad joke. Some stupid plan to get a scream or a laugh or excitement sex or some- thing, but he sure as hell wasn&#x2019;t getting any off this.<br><br> And it wasn&#x2019;t his sort of thing.<br><br> She circled through &nbsp;the living room. It had a thick carpet, almost silent to walk across. Just make it through the house, give Ben one last time to admit he was an idiot, and then out the door. She&#x2019;d call 911 from the front yard.<br><br> She was halfway across the living room when she heard the sound of metal sliding across metal. It was a fast, back-and-forth with a hard snap at the end. She&#x2019;d heard it a lot at the range. She&#x2019;d been the one making it.<br><br> She swallowed.<br><br> Becky looked down at her phone. Could she raise her voice enough to talk? Did the person &nbsp;upstairs know where she was in the house? What did 911 do when they got a silent call? Did they trace it and send a car? Did they hang up?&nbsp;<br><br> She had to get out of the house now.<br><br> The front door was closer, but it was a clear shot&#x2014;bad &nbsp;choice of words&#x2014;a &nbsp;clear&nbsp;<i>line of sight &nbsp;</i>for anyone &nbsp;in the &nbsp;upstairs &nbsp;hall. Almost straight from their bedroom door to the front door.<br> The back door was farther away, but there was more weaving and someone would have to get much closer to aim&#x2014;to&nbsp;<i>see&nbsp;</i>her. She&#x2019;d have a chance to make the call. But the backyard was a wall of fences around a pool they hadn&#x2019;t filled for the summer yet. She&#x2019;d have to run back around to the side gate. And no one would be able to see her. Maybe not even hear her, with all the noise from that new house they were putting up one block over.<br><br> Plenty of time and opportunity for someone to grab her and drag her back into the house. It had to be the front door.<br><br> Becky gripped the knife, made sure her finger was still near the call button, and took three long strides across the living room. The carpet absorbed her footsteps, but she heard the fabric of her jeans and felt the air move around her.<br><br> Her foot hit the hall and she heard the creak of the second step from the top of the staircase. She froze. They were on the stairs. They&#x2019;d see her going for the front door.<br><br> She should&#x2019;ve gone out the back. She still could. But she&#x2019;d have to be fast. They&#x2019;d hear her for sure.<br><br> She ran for the door. Feet thumped &nbsp;on the stairs behind &nbsp;her. She reached for the knob.<br><br> &#x201c;Stop!&#x201d;<br><br> She turned and raised her knife. &#x201c;You fuckhead,&#x201d; she gasped.<br><br> Ben stood on the staircase, four steps from the bottom. One foot was still on the fifth. He was wearing the charcoal suit with the cranberry shirt that looked so good on him. The Glock was in his hand, its barrel pointed in her direction. He clutched his own phone in his other hand.<br> &#x201c;Put the knife down.&#x201d;<br><br> Becky&#x2019;s shoulders slumped and she tossed the knife on the table. It slid to a stop right where his keys usually landed. &#x201c;You scared the piss out of me, you jerk. I thought someone was in the house.&#x201d;<br><br> He lowered himself to the next step. The pistol rose up. She could see enough of the muzzle to tell it was aimed at her.<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve called the police,&#x201d; he hissed. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re on the line right now.&#x201d; She glanced past him up the staircase, then her eyes went back to the gun. Had they&nbsp;<i>both&nbsp;</i>been playing tag with an intruder? &#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Calm down and point that somewhere else.&#x201d;<br><br>Ben stared at her and came down two more steps. The pistol didn&#x2019;t waver. His wide eyes flitted to the knife, then past her to the front door, and over into the living room. &#x201c;Where is she?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Babe,&#x201d; she said, her eyes on the pistol, &#x201c;you&#x2019;re freaking me out with the&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Where is she?&#x201d; he shouted. His voice echoed in the hall. The glass in the door trembled behind her.<br><br> She shrieked and her mind stumbled for a moment. &#x201c;She? She who?&#x201d; Ben stepped off the staircase and glared at her. He raised the pistol. The barrel was just a black square with a hole in it. He was aiming it right between her eyes. &#x201c;What have you done with her? What do you<br>want with us?&#x201d; He took a step toward her, and then another.<br><br> Becky couldn&#x2019;t tell if he was angry or sad. The black hole kept pull- ing her eyes away from his face. It was just a few feet away. She could see the little trembles and shifts as he squeezed the grip. &#x201c;Babe,&#x201d; she pleaded, &#x201c;what are you talking abou&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Who are you?&#x201d; he yelled. &#x201c;<i>Where&nbsp;the hell is my wife?</i>&#x201d;</p><h2>Old Time Radios!

Inspired by her commencement speech at the College of the Holy Cross, the book contains stories and insights that will be helpful, entertaining, and encouraging to graduates at every stage of life. The lessons themselves--"be willing to fail," "stand your ethical ground," "marriage is a hell of a lot of hard work"--are nothing new. What makes them interesting are the life stories that accompany them and Shriver's personable, friendly style. Reading this book feels like having a cup of coffee with a wise and funny friend. Tales of her first television experiences are surprising and hilarious, and she takes balancing motherhood and career to new levels--imagine postponing an interview with Fidel Castro to get your daughter to her first day of kindergarten! Each chapter is easy to read and ends with a focused lesson--kind of a bullet point from her original speech--that encourages readers to be ultimately true to themselves and their dreams, while cutting through harmful illusions. The last chapter, on laughter, is one to read again and again. Shriver maintains that without laughter not much else matters, and in life's toughest times it's laughter that gets us through. For anyone starting a new adventure--graduation, marriage, parenthood, career shift, or a milestone birthday--<i>Ten Things I Wish I'd Known</i> brings wisdom, laughter, practical suggestions, and a down-to-earth manner together into one fabulous gift. <i>--Jill Lightner</i>Maria Shriver puts her &#34;commas&#34; in the following order: mother, wife, daughter, sister, friend, Peabody Award- and Emmy Award-winning journalist, New York Times bestselling author (for What&#39;s Heaven?), and forty-plus woman desperately seeking more time, more patience, a homework helper, and a twenty-one-year-old&#39;s skin and body. She lives with her husband and four children in Santa Monica, California.</p><h2>Young&#39;s Literal Translation of the Bible-OE</h2><p>Robert Young&#39;s 1898 edition of his translation. This is the third and last edition that he produced. Translation uses the same Elizabethian language that the King James Version uses. However, being a strictly literal translation, the word order is different from the KJV, so it does read different than the KJV and can be difficult at times to read. Being a strictly literal translation makes it the perfect study tool. You can now see exactly what God said and how He said it. There is no changing of words, no softening of words or passages, just translated strictly as it was written in the original languages. Text is done in 9 point print, which is larger and easier to read than the print sizes used in the past by other publishers. Sturdy 4-color hardback cover. This translation will allow the reader to see exactly what God said and will allow a more precise study of the Bible. How can a reader study a Bible when the translators have have interpreted instead of translated? The vast number of modern translation interpret (tell you what they thought God meant) instead of translate (tell you what God actually said). When Robert Young translated this edition, he was not trying to please or appease someone, he was not trying to be politically correct, he was not translating in an attempt to rewrite the Bible to fit his theological beliefs. With this Bible, you get the word of God and nothing but the word of God.</p><p>Thanks to all for the valuable feedback you have given on this volume of the "Holy Bible Young's Literal Translation." We hear you!<br>Some feedback refers to the small size of the print and how everything crowds together. I actually agree with this... and wish we could do better. I tried some larger and different fonts... to no avail. I am actually considering removing it from our available titles. We do not want to hurt anyone, and I think you can actually get a better version from other vendors.<br>I am going to make a few changes, and review the feedback again in a month or two. I will then make a decision on whether to continue the publication. Thanks again for the reviews... and may the Lord bless you as you study and learn from our Lord's Word!<br>C.

The crooks fled with duffle bags crammed full of cash, gold, silver, stamps, coins, jewels and high-end jewelry. The true value of the loot has always been kept secret, partly because it was ill-gotten to begin with, and partly because there was plenty of incentive to keep its true worth out of the limelight. It&#39;s one thing for authorities to admit they didn&#39;t find a trace of goods worth from $3 million to $4 million, and entirely another when what was at stake was more accurately valued at about $30 million, the equivalent of $120 million today. It was the biggest single payday in the criminal history of the Northeast. Nobody came close, not the infamous James &#34;Whitey&#34; Bulger, not John &#34;The Dapper Don&#34; Gotti, not even the Brinks or Wells Fargo robbers. The heist was bold enough and big enough to rock the underworld to its core, and it left La Cosa Nostra in the region awash in turmoil that still reverberates more than forty years later. Last Good Heist is the inside story of the robbery and its aftermath.</p><p>Tim White is an Emmy-winning investigative reporter for WPRI-TV, the CBS affiliate in Providence; Randall Richard is a former investigative reporter and international correspondent for the Providence Journal and national reporter at the Associated Press, and Wayne Worcester is a former reporter and editor at the Providence Journal, novelist, essayist and a professor emeritus in journalism at the University of Connecticut."Raymond Patriarca - a mob boss more frightening and more powerful than Whitey Bulger on his best day. I thought I knew all there was to know about this major player in organized crime history but I was wrong - dead wrong. Now comes The Last Good Heist, a classic gangster yarn from Tim White, Randall Richard and Wayne Worcester. Together, these authors weave a story that is too unbelievable to be true. But it is. Through exhaustive research and a wildly entertaining narrative, White, Richard and Worcester show us how the once powerful New England Mafia was destroyed to rubble from within. The Last Good Heist is a damn good ride." <br>-Casey Sherman, New York Times Bestselling Author of &#x201c;The Finest Hours,&#x201d; &#x201c;Boston Strong&#x201d; and &#x201c;Animal: The Bloody Rise and Fall of the Mob's Most Feared Assassin.&#x201d;<br><br>***<br><br>&#x201c;An incredibly entertaining true crime saga that catapults you into a world of incorrigible thieves, powerful Mafiosi and cunning cops. This masterfully written and thoroughly researched book by White, Richard and Worcester, three journalists who know the story best, makes you feel like you are there in mid-70s Providence, RI, rubbing elbows with the crooks and ducking for cover. A vivid account and a great, great read.&#x201d;<br>-Shelley Murphy, co-author of New York Times Bestseller &#x201c;Whitey Bulger.&#x201d;<br><br>***<br><br>&#x201c;The Last Good Heist is an adrenaline rush, a page-turning true-crime thriller that takes the reader inside one of the greatest Mafia capers of all time.

Marino Marino makes oyster stew, while thinking up interesting math problems. A man in a porkpie hat buys cherry pies. <b>Maira Kalman</b>'s stylized artwork, along with entertaining text, brilliantly captures the excitement of Grand Central Station, "the busiest, fastest, biggest place there is."</p><p>"Trains are trips. And trips are adventures. And adventures are new ideas and romance and you can't ever know what in the world will happen which is exactly why you are going." This is precisely the species of serendipity that bounces and leaps through the pages of Maira Kalman's picture book <i>Next Stop Grand Central</i>, a charming tribute to New York's Grand Central Station by the artist whose murals currently spice up the historic terminal. Kalman--brilliant creator of Max the millionaire poet dog in <i>Ooh-la-la (Max in Love)</i>--not only reflects the vibrant nature of the busy hub, she paints comical portraits of the folks behind the scenes who make it all happen: ("Etha delivers the mail--a letter to Mr. Pickle <i>cannot</i> go to Mr. Schnikle.") We're also introduced to the people who "zip and zap and whiz" through Grand Central as passengers: ("The woman with the blue pancake hat is going to Chinatown to buy Poo Nik Tea.") Snapshots of "things you'll see" in the terminal include someone waiting patiently, someone waiting impatiently, and someone looking up. Things you won't see? Einstein sailing and the pyramids of Giza. <i>Next Stop Grand Central</i> is a compassionate, quirky view of a cross-section of humanity--and that, Kalman seems to be saying, is what Grand Central Station is all about.

Complicating the natural mourning process is the fact that this loss often occurs in our thirties, forties, or fifties--as we are raising our own children, watching them leave the nest, and facing other adjustments in our lives, from our jobs to our marriages to our health. This thoughtful exploration of a neglected subject explains the emotional impact of losing our parents in the midst of midlife--and why many underestimate it. Discussing such topics as changes in self-image, unresolved issues, guilt, sorrow, and anger, the emotional impact of inheritance, and the shifting of roles as a result of "midlife orphanhood," <b>Jane Brooks</b> shows us how to find new sources of strength, in both ourselves and others, after our parents are gone.</p><p><b>Jane Brooks</b> has a master's degree in educational technology from the university of Maryland, and is the co-author of <b>The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Guide to Common Childhood Infections</b>.

I'm not sure whether I'm drawn to it or it's drawn to me, but at every point in my eighty years, I've been faced with a challenge, and in just about every instance I've taken it. Even my birth was a do-or-die proposition.<br><br>My mother went into labor on May 21, 1928. It was a long ordeal, and things weren't going well. The doctor, George Wallace, took my father, Tom, into a small room and closed the door. He had a grave look on his face, and my father immediately spotted a large book on a table. He assumed it was a Bible.<br><br>"Your wife has been in labor a long time, and she can't deliver. I'm worried about her. You can save your wife or your baby, but not both," Dr. Wallace said.<br><br>My father wasn't an either-or sort of guy. He was a natural-born risk taker and the son of a Methodist preacher. And so when Dr. Wallace, who happened to be a surgeon, told him that it was either my mother, Grace, or me, my father refused to choose. He pleaded with the doctor to try the first Caesarean section in that hospital's history.<br><br>"Well, Tom, I've heard about a C-section, but I've never done one," the doctor said. He pointed to the book on the table. "All I've got is a page and a half and one picture in that medical book to go by."<br><br>"We're gonna pray, and you're gonna deliver the baby," my father told him.<br><br>A short time later, Dr. Wallace came out of the operating room with a broad smile on his face. He had just performed his first Caesarean. The procedure wouldn't be repeated at that hospital for more than twenty-five years. Dr. Wallace was a surgeon-no general practitioner would have ever performed a C-section-and he'd lived in that small town in Oklahoma for just two years. The odds of him being the man that delivered me were slim at best. I've always thought I was the luckiest man alive, and right from the start I proved it.<br><br>"You've got a little boy," Dr. Wallace told my father. "And your wife is doing fine."<br><br>the sign read: welcome to holdenville. where the pavement ends, the west begins, and the rock island crosses the frisco. And that, sports fans, was Holdenville, a railroad town in eastern Oklahoma, a speck in the grand sweep of the Great Plains, where the open land was vast, rolling, and endless.<br><br>My father was in the oil business. Outgoing, generous, a great<br><br>storyteller, and a gifted poker player, he arrived in Holdenville at age twenty-five. He was a lawyer but soon realized that law was nowhere near as exciting as oil. So he became an independent land man, convincing landowners to lease him their mineral rights, which he in turn sold to oil companies. I was an only child, but I was always surrounded by family who lived next door: my grandmother Nellie Molonson; my widowed aunt, Ethel Reed; and my cousin Billy Bob, who was like an older brother to me. My parents were hardworking, thrifty, honest, and self-sufficient. They came from an era when a job was viewed as a privilege, not a right. I grew up during the Great Depression, but our family always had food on the table. My grandmother had a large vegetable garden, and each night she served fresh or canned vegetables. Some nights we had meat to go with the vegetables, and some nights we didn't, but we were never hungry.<br><br>My mother, Grace-the disciplinarian in our family-instilled important lessons in me early on, which prepared me for the challenges ahead. During the war, she ran our area's Office of Price Administration, which rationed gasoline and other goods. She had a great sense of integrity; if she said she would do something, you could consider it done. My grandmother Nellie was so disciplined that most nights she would have only one cup of tea and a slice of dry whole wheat toast for supper. She taught me things I've never forgotten.<br><br>"Remember, a fool and his money are soon parted," she said when I told her I was going to spend 50 cents on a haircut, a movie, and a bag of popcorn.<br><br>"Sometime, everybody has to learn to sit on their own bottom," she said whenever I asked for too much help with something.<br><br>As soon as I was old enough, I started mowing lawns, which I did until I could take on a paper route at age twelve. I began on a street grandly named Broadway of America with the smallest route in town: twenty-eight houses with a penny-a-paper profit per day. When other routes came open next to mine, I talked my supervisor into letting me take them on. Within five years my route grew from 28 papers to 156 and I had saved close to $200, which I hid in a hole under the floor in my closet. It was my first experience in the takeover field: expansion by acquisition.<br><br>In my first year as a paperboy, I found a wallet on the sidewalk. Inside it were the name and address of the owner. I delivered it to the man, and he gave me a dollar reward. It was a windfall. My mother, grandmother, and aunt were on the porch when I got home. They didn't respond as I'd expected or hoped to the news of my finding the wallet and getting the reward. They didn't looked at one another. They didn't have to. They were so much alike that their heads moved in unison, almost as if each head was attached to the others by a string. I pleaded my case over and over, but they sent me straight back to return the dollar to the man.<br><br>"You are not going to be paid to be honest," my grandmother told me.<br><br>So I had to go back to the man and give his dollar back.<br><br>"No, no, this is for you!"<br><br>"I know!"<br><br>"And you should have it!"<br><br>"I know!"<br><br>But I also knew better than to go against anything my mother, grandmother, and aunt told me. I gave the money back and headed home on my bike in a downpour. I damn near drowned. I got home drenched and looking for sympathy. I could play the pitiful routine really well. Aunt Ethel didn't buy it.<br><br>"If you hadn't argued with us, you'd have been back before it rained," she said.<br><br>In 1927 a major oil field had been discovered in Seminole, a sleepy little town just down the road from Holdenville. It had turned into a boomtown. By 1938 the search for big oil in our area had run its course. My father began to run out of luck. Instead of playing it safe with land deals, he started investing in wildcats, which were wells drilled by independent oilmen in uncharted territory. Successful wildcats came with big payoffs-but at great risk. Our family was soon pinched. The yellow Pierce Arrow sedan my father had bought for my mother during a streak of good luck was gone; our Chevy wasn't new anymore. Dad took a job with a regular paycheck at Phillips Petroleum Company. In 1943, he was reassigned to an office in the Texas Panhandle. My mother and I joined him in 1944. I was sixteen, loved Holdenville, and didn't want to leave. But move we did. I had learned important lessons from my high school basketball coach in Armarillo, T. G. Hull. He told us to play all out but not to dwell on either successes or losses. He taught me that when the game is over, it's over.<br><br>Our team did well in high school basketball, and I attended Texas A&amp;M on a basketball scholarship. A little short and slow for college basketball, I lost my scholarship after a year and transferred to Oklahoma A&amp;M at Stillwater (now Oklahoma State University) my sophomore year. At my father's urging, I decided to switch my major to geology. When I graduated at the age of twenty-two, Phillips Petroleum hired me as a geologist. It was a difficult time in the oil industry. Geologist jobs were in short supply. By this time in my life, I had mowed lawns and thrown papers. I'd worked on a drilling rig as a roughneck, on the railroad as a fireman, and in a refinery. Hard work was nothing new to me. "What kind of master plan did you have back in your early career?" people ask me. I was married and had a child when I took my job with Phillips; the master plan was simply to get everybody fed.<br><br>Back when I was with Phillips, I was working with three geologists and a couple of engineers on a joint interest well. I was making $5,000 a year. One of the geologists asked, "If you could lock in a salary right now for the rest of your life and work until you're sixty-five years old, what would you sign up for?" Everybody thought about it; I was the only one who answered. I had a wife and two kids by then and wanted to ensure that my family lived comfortably.<br><br>What would I work for without raises until I turned sixty-five?<br><br>"Twenty-five thousand dollars," I said finally. At that period of my life, security was very important to me. Thank goodness it was only a conversation.<br><br>at phillips, I met the monster: Big Oil. Phillips was one of the twenty largest corporations in America. It had 20,000 employees, chemical and plastic divisions, refineries, an international operation, hundreds of Phillips 66 gas stations, and two dozen exploration and production offices-all run by a big and sluggish army of bureaucrats. I went to work in the home office in Bartlesville, Oklahoma. Every morning a bell rang at five minutes before eight, signaling you to your desk, just like in school. At noon, everyone would be standing by the door, waiting for the lunch bell. At one, the bell would ring, signaling that lunch was over. The final bell rang at five, and they didn't want anybody staying past quitting time.<br><br>(I once got reprimanded for staying until six.) Paranoia was rampant. What sickened me most was the waste. Management was incapable of listening to or even considering alternative ideas to save the company money or find more oil.<br><br>"If you're unhappy, why don't you quit?" my wife asked me after one of many nights of hearing my complaints. I don't think she meant it or dreamed that I would actually do it. After three years, five months, twenty-one days, and four hours, I did exactly what she suggested. I went over the wall.<br><br>"I want your car keys and your credit card," the division manager told me.<br><br>I walked out of the office with all of my belongings in a pasteboard box and headed for the bus. Although I was more than a little scared, I felt as though somebody had taken his foot off my neck. We had two young daughters by then and another baby on the way. Christmas was just around the corner.<br><br>My wife was surprised when I walked into the house.<br><br>"What are you doing home at three o'clock?" she asked.<br><br>"I just quit," I said.<br><br>"Have you lost your mind?"<br><br>"No, I did what you told me to do last night," I said. "You told me to quit if I didn't like where I worked, so I did."<br><br>"I didn't mean that! I didn't think you would actually do it."<br><br>She paused for a minute.<br><br>"Boone, what are you going to do now?"<br><br>Someday I would challenge Big Oil, but right then I had more pressing needs. I had to make a living. I was twenty-six when I went out on my own in 1954, the youngest independent geologist in the Texas Panhandle. I used the $1,300 in my Phillips thrift plan as a down payment on a 1955 Ford station wagon and started out as a consultant doing well-site work for $75 a day. Those days were too few. My back was against the wall. When I was doing well-site work, I often slept in my car and shaved in service stations. At the end of my first year on my own I had put together seven drilling deals in addition to my consulting work. I knew I was not going to get rich on $75 a day. But if I could put enough deals together, I could make a decent living and accumulate some equity. Maybe then I could<br><br>get rich.<br><br>Two years later I formed my first oil company with two investors. They put in $1,250 each for half the stock and established a $100,000 line of credit for our new company. I gave them a $2,500 note for my half. The company was called Petroleum Exploration Inc. (PEI). Then I hit the road again to find more investors willing to finance a drilling program for a group of wells. Except for a few members of my family, no one gave me a prayer of succeeding. My single-minded focus gave me an edge: I was now going to succeed or fall on my ass. In fact I always think I have an edge, but I love to be the underdog.<br><br>One day a geologist friend said, "You're getting pretty unpopular with the other geologists here in town. You never come over to the Embers and have a drink after work." The Embers was a bar three or four blocks away from my office.<br><br>"Well, you guys are going over there at three o'clock in the afternoon. That's not after work," I told him.<br><br>He didn't think that was funny. We were in a pretty rough period in the industry, and all of us were struggling. "We're all having a hard time," he said.<br><br>"Yeah, it's a tough time for the industry, but I don't think the Embers at three o'clock in the afternoon is the place to solve anything," I said.<br><br>"Look, Boone, why don't you come by and have a drink with us anyway?"<br><br>"OK," I said, and stopped off at the Embers after work. By then, they had already had three or four beers, so everybody was getting pretty loose. The Embers had some attractive waitresses, and they were all laughing and cutting up. I had a beer and hung around for a little while.<br><br>"I'm heading home," I said. "You guys hang around here and somebody's going to get into trouble."</p><h2>Ecuador - Culture Smart!: The Essential Guide to Customs &amp; Culture (56)</h2><p>Squeezed between Colombia in the north and Peru in the south, Ecuador is named for its location on the Equator and has a landscape so varied that it has been described as a microcosm of every microclimate found in South America. This diversity makes it a magnet for tourists, mountain trekkers, volunteers, and increasing numbers of US retirees looking for a warm, culturally interesting, economical, and safe place to spend much of their time. The country is booming, thanks to high oil prices and investment in tourism, and a massive infrastructure program and the poverty-reduction measures launched by President Rafael Correa have endeared him to the poorest in society. Ecuador&#x2019;s multiethnic population reflects a unique blend of cultures, from traditionally dressed mountain peoples, whose ancestors inhabited their highland villages before the arrival of the Incas, to the Afro-Ecuadorians of Esmeraldas and the Chota Valley and the tribal peoples of the Amazonian rainforest. The Ecuadorians are proud, friendly, hospitable, and hardworking, but to know them well the foreign visitor needs to understand the complex historical divisions between the highlands and the coast, and the rigid class and racial hierarchy that has shaped the country&#x2019;s history. <i>Culture Smart!

For if we honor that commitment, we will never be vanquished�but if we falter in that loyalty, we will all be condemned." </p> <p> The crowning achievement of a truly phenomenal career, Mario Puzo's final novel is a remarkable epic of greed, treachery, sin, and power beyond mortal imagination. It is a journey to a different time and place�when the Church held the ultimate authority and ambition was cloaked in robes of the richest velvet. But most of all, it is the spellbinding story of a father and his children, bonded by blood, devotion, and dark purpose, who would descend into hell to rise to challenge the heavens; a family whose name is forever emblazoned in the annals of infamy . . . Borgia! </p></p><p><p>Mario Puzo was the author of the international bestseller <em>The Godfather</em> and cowrote the screenplays for the Academy Award-winning trio of films based on the book. Puzo's other books include <em>The Last Don</em> and <em>Omerta</em>, both <em>New York Times</em> bestsellers.</p>Before his death in [1999], Puzo (The Last Don) had begun work on a novel featuring the 15th-century Borgias, whom he regarded as "the original crime family." There are obvious parallels between the Borgias and the Corleone clan immortalized in The Godfather, but the resemblances are mostly superficial, at least as they are presented in this limp historical romance. The story opens with Cardinal Rodrigo Borgia manipulating papal elections in 1492 to become the new Pope Alexander. Determined to establish a family dynasty, he appoints his son Cesare cardinal in his stead and, after a strategically engineered episode of incest between siblings Cesare and Lucrezia, begins ruthlessly eliminating rivals and marrying his children into alliances with the offspring of noble families of France and Spain. But Cesare would rather be a soldier, and Lucrezia would rather marry for love; these conflicted desires contribute as much as risky political power plays to undoing the Borgias in a single generation. Though Gino (Puzo's companion, author of Then an Angel Came) is credited for the posthumous completion, Puzo's true collaborator is history, and it proves a difficult partner. Obligated not to deviate from known facts, the narrative whizzes methodically through highlights of the Renaissance, embellishing events with snatches of imagined dialogue, purple prose ("For love can steal free will using no weapons but itself") and cameos by Machiavelli, Michelangelo and da Vinci. Overwhelmed by the vast pageant of events, the characters never achieve dramatic stature. Puzo's diehard fans will surely put the novel on their summer hit list, but they may feel, in Sonny Corleone's words, that "this isn't personal, it's business."

Though the Confederacy has defeated its northern enemy twice, this time the United States has allied with the Kaiser. In the South, the freed slaves, fueled by Marxist rhetoric and the bitterness of a racist nation, take up the weapons of the Red rebellion. Despite these advantages, the United States remains pinned between Canada and the Confederate States of America, so the bloody conflict continues and grows. Both presidents&#x2014;Theodore Roosevelt of the Union and staunch Confederate Woodrow Wilson&#x2014;are stubbornly determined to lead their nations to victory, at <i>any</i> cost. . .</p><p>Harry Turtledove marches on through history with <i>The Great War: Walk in Hell</i>. In his alternate timeline, the Confederate States of America won the Civil War, aided by Britain and France. In the 1880s (<i>How Few Remain</i>), Americans fought again after the CSA acquired parts of Mexico--and the CSA won again. When WWI begins with Archduke Ferdinand's assassination in 1914 (<i>The Great War: American Front</i>), the 34-state USA under Teddy Roosevelt allies with Imperial Germany and Austria against Britain, France, Russia, Japan, Canada, and Woodrow Wilson's CSA. Trenches divide Canada, fierce fighting rages from Tennessee and Kentucky into Pennsylvania, a Mormon uprising against the USA consumes Utah, and a black socialist rebellion distracts the CSA, where slavery has ended but blacks still await full citizenship.<p> <i>Walk in Hell</i> takes us from fall, 1915, through 1916. Soldiers, sailors, and airmen continue the fight, but much happens behind the lines too. Turtledove's characters include Jewish immigrants who are socialist and antiwar, a widow running a coffee house in CSA-occupied Washington, D.C., who passes information to the USA, and two Canadian farmers living under U.S. occupation in Quebec and Manitoba. He vividly conveys the human side of war. When Joe Hammerschmitt gets a shoulder wound in the Virginia trenches: </p><blockquote> ... pain warred with exultation on his long, thin face. Exultation won. 'Got me a hometowner, looks like,' he said happily. Half the men up there with him made sympathetic noises; the other half looked frankly jealous. Hammerschmitt was going to be out of the firing line for weeks, maybe months, to come, and they still risked not just death but horrible mutilation every day.</blockquote><p> Some find Turtledove's cast too large, the story's action too slow. Others complain that <i>Walk in Hell</i> is too similar to his Worldwar series. Alternate history buffs, however, will marvel at his mastery of detail, enjoy following his logic as he pursues military and social developments onward in time, and find it hard to wait for the next in the series. <i>--Nona Vero</i></p>The year is 1915, and the world is convulsing.

She lives in Berkeley, California.1<br><br>In 1938, the year I was twelve, my hometown of Macedonia, West Virginia, celebrated its sesquicentennial, a word I thought had to do with fruit for the longest time. In school, we commemorated the occasion as we commemorated most occasions, with tableaux, one for each of the major events in Macedonia&#x2019;s history. There weren&#x2019;t many, hardly enough to stretch out across eight grades, but the teachers eked them out the best they could. If it hadn&#x2019;t been for the War Between the States, I don&#x2019;t know what they would have done. When Virginia seceded from the Union, western Virginia got mad and seceded right back into it, all except four little counties, one of them ours, that stuck out their tongues at West Virginia and declared themselves part of the Confederacy, a piece of sass with long consequences in the way of road-paving and school desks.<br><br>Tucked up in a crook between the Potomac and the Shenandoah, Macedonia was a junction for generals and railroads alike, and by the time Lee hung up his sword at Appomattox, the town had changed hands forty-seven times, six of them in one day. Our teachers dearly loved to get up a scene of the townspeople stuffing their Confederate flags up the chimney as the Union troops marched in and yanking them back down again as the troops departed. The fourth-, fifth-, and sixth-graders got the war scenes, and the seventh- and eighth-graders got the short end of the stick, because not a thing happened in Macedonia after 1865, except the roundhouse blowing up and the American Everlasting Hosiery Company opening its doors. Half the town worked in that mill and the other half wished it did, but there was not much about the American Everlasting Hosiery Company that looked good in a tableau. Sometimes the teachers gave up and killed two birds with one stone by making the seventh-graders march across the stage, waving socks, while the eighth-graders sang &#x201c;The Star-Spangled Banner&#x201d; behind them. In 1938, though, the eighth grade hit pay dirt, because Mrs. Roosevelt drove through town. She stopped at the square, took a drink from our sulfur-spring water fountain, made a face, and drove away. That was plenty for a tableau, except that instead of making a face, the eighth-grade Mrs. Roosevelt said, &#x201c;The people of Macedonia are lucky to receive the benefits of healthful mineral water.&#x201d; My sister Bird and I laughed so hard we got sent into the hall.<br><br>Once the curtain had clunked down on our tableaux and we&#x2019;d been herded back into our classrooms, I supposed that Macedonia&#x2019;s sesquicentennial festivities were concluded. Hadn&#x2019;t we just covered one hundred and fifty years of history in twenty-three minutes flat? We had. But not a week later came the Decoration Day parade, and that, I realized later, was the real beginning of the sesquicentennial. Later still, I realized that everything began that day. Everything that was to heave itself free of its foundations over the course of the summer began to rattle lightly on the morning of the parade. That was when I first heard of Layla Beck, when I began to wonder about my father, and when I noticed I was being lied to and decided to leave my childhood behind. I have since wondered, of course, how my life&#x2014;and my father&#x2019;s and my aunt Jottie&#x2019;s, too&#x2014;would have been different if I&#x2019;d decided to stay at home that morning. This is what&#x2019;s called the enigma of history, and it can drive you out of your mind if you let it.<br><br>Jottie and I were packed tight on the sidewalk, together with everyone else in town, to watch the parade. Usually it wasn&#x2019;t much, the Decoration Day parade, just a matter of assorted veterans looking grim and the high school marching band. But this year, in honor of the sesquicentennial, we&#x2019;d been promised an extra-fancy show, a real spectacle. And that was what we got: The United Daughters of the Confederacy flounced out first, with the Ladies of the Grand Army of the Republic hot on their heels. Then the Rotary band struck up with patriotic tunes, which was a lot to manage on four trumpets and had a terrible effect on the pony brigade. The veterans marched along, a pair of girls in skimpy outfits flung batons in the air, just exactly like a movie parade, except that only one of them could catch. We even had a float, The Apple Princess and Her Blossoms, smiling on the back of a truck. Out came the mayor, waving from his big green car, and behind him was Mr. Parker Davies, who had got himself up in a sword and knee pants to look like General Magnus Hamilton, the founder of Macedonia, which put me in mind of a question I had always wanted to ask. I nudged my aunt Jottie. &#x201c;How come he called it Macedonia?&#x201d;<br><br>She tilted her dark eyes down to mine. &#x201c;The General was a great admirer of the Macedonian virtues.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Huh.&#x201d; That was news to me. &#x201c;What are they, the Macedonian virtues?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t say huh. Ferocity and devotion.&#x201d; The Apple Princess joggled by. It was Elsie Averill in a white dress. A lady standing just behind me leaned forward for a better look, and a big whiff of Jungle Gardenia went up my nose. <br><br>I squeezed closer to Jottie. &#x201c;Did he have them?&#x201d; I asked.<br><br>Jottie&#x2019;s eyes followed Elsie for a bit. &#x201c;Did he have what?&#x201d; she murmured.<br><br>&#x201c;Jottie!&#x201d; I recalled her. &#x201c;Did General Hamilton have the Macedonian virtues?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The General?&#x201d; She lifted one eyebrow. &#x201c;The General once chopped off a soldier&#x2019;s toes to keep the poor man from deserting. You tell me, Willa: Is that ferocity, devotion, or just plain crazy?&#x201d;<br><br>I eyed Mr. Parker Davies, imagining his bloodied sword raised high, a little toe speared on the point. That was ferocity, I was pretty sure. &#x201c;Do I have them?&#x201d; I asked hopefully.<br><br>Jottie smiled. &#x201c;Ferocity and devotion? You want those?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re virtues, aren&#x2019;t they?&#x201d; I asked.<br><br>&#x201c;They surely are. Ferocity, devotion, and a nickel will get you a cup of coffee at the Pickus Caf�.&#x201d; I made a face at her, and she laughed. The parade passed by, turned around on itself, and straggled back up Prince Street.<br><br>I thought maybe I had a chance at devotion.<br><br>Now the Macedonia Chamber of Commerce made the turn and marched by, eight men in identical tan hats and overcoats. They looked like a set of matching boy dolls, only embarrassed. Jottie chuckled and flapped her little flag. &#x201c;Hooray!&#x201d; she cheered. &#x201c;Hooray for our brave boys in the Chamber of Commerce!&#x201d;<br><br>They pretended they didn&#x2019;t hear, all except one. &#x201c;Jottie?&#x201d; he said, swiveling around. Jottie drew in a sharp breath, and I saw two spots of pink appear on her cheeks. She started to put up her hand, let it drop, and then changed her mind and lifted it in a little wave. That set him up; now he started smiling like crazy, and even though the parade was moving again, he called out to her, &#x201c;I was hoping I might see you today, Jottie, I was thinking I might&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>A man behind bumped into him then, and he had to walk on, but he kept turning around to wave at her as he went. <br><br>&#x201c;Who was that?&#x201d; I asked. Nothing happened, so I gave her a poke. &#x201c;Who was that, Jottie?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sol,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Sol McKubin.&#x201d; She opened her purse and rummaged inside. &#x201c;I had a handkerchief in here this morning.&#x201d;<br><br>And that would have been that, if I hadn&#x2019;t heard a low laugh behind me. It was Mrs. Jungle Gardenia. &#x201c;Shoo-oo, good thing old Felix ain&#x2019;t here,&#x201d; she hooted softly to herself.<br><br>What? I whirled around, wondering who she was and how she knew my father.<br><br>She didn&#x2019;t look like someone he would know. She was wearing a young lady&#x2019;s dress, even though she wasn&#x2019;t a young lady, and her face was white with powder. She caught my stare and wiggled her drawn-on eyebrows at me. I turned back to Jottie quick.<br><br>&#x201c;Jottie,&#x201d; I said, giving her another poke. &#x201c;Who&#x2019;s Sol McKubin?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Is that Miss Kissining there across the street?&#x201d; Jottie squinted at the sidewalk opposite. &#x201c;In that polka-dot dress?&#x201d;<br><br>I looked. It wasn&#x2019;t any more Miss Kissining than it was the Lindbergh baby. &#x201c;You must be going blind, Jottie,&#x201d; I began scornfully, but I was drowned out by the Rotary band giving their final honk on &#x201c;The Battle Hymn of the Republic.&#x201d; The parade was over.<br><br>That was all right with me. My favorite part came after, anyway. I took hold of Jottie&#x2019;s hand, and we sailed out into the wake of the marchers.<br><br>It was like a second parade, with all of Macedonia milling along Prince Street, busying themselves with the real entertainment of the day: calling out, stopping to chat, and gathering into little knots to deliver up their opinions about the ponies, the batons, the float, and the mayor&#x2019;s car. I dearly loved to walk down a street with my aunt Jottie. When I went alone, I was a child, and grown-ups ignored me accordingly. Sometimes, of course, they&#x2019;d stop me to offer improving advice like Tie your shoelaces before you trip and knock out those teeth of yours, but for the most part, I was a worm in mud. Beneath notice, as they say in books. When I walked with Jottie, it was a different matter. Grown-ups greeted me politely, and that was nice. That was real pleasant. But the best thing, the very best thing about walking through town with my arm through Jottie&#x2019;s was listening to her recount the secret history of every man, woman, dog, and flower bed we passed, sideways out of the corner of her mouth so that only I could hear. Those were moments of purest satisfaction to me. Why? Because when she told me those secrets, Jottie made me something better than just a temporary grown-up. She made me her confidante.<br><br>We were strolling up the street when we came upon Mr. Tare Russell in his bath chair. He wasn&#x2019;t real old, Mr. Russell, but there was something the matter with him, and he had to be rolled around town with a blanket over his knees. When he saw us, he yelped, &#x201c;Jottie Romeyn, you just come over here and let me feast my eyes on you!&#x201d; Then he waggled his fingers so that his Negro servant would push the bath chair faster. It didn&#x2019;t seem right; that poor man looked a lot older and feebler than Mr. Russell.<br><br>&#x201c;Tare!&#x201d; said Jottie. &#x201c;What brings you here? I&#x2019;ve never known you to come to the parade before!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Civic duty,&#x201d; said Mr. Russell. &#x201c;What kind of a person would miss Macedonia&#x2019;s sesquicentennial parade?&#x201d;<br><br>Jottie grinned. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been asking myself that very question, Tare, all morning long. How&#x2019;d you like The Apple Princess and Her Blossoms?&#x201d;<br><br>He didn&#x2019;t answer. In fact, he almost interrupted her, he spoke so quick. &#x201c;I thought Felix would be marching with the veterans. But he wasn&#x2019;t. I didn&#x2019;t see him.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Felix is away on business,&#x201d; said Jottie.<br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s been gone all week,&#x201d; I added helpfully.<br><br>&#x201c;Business,&#x201d; repeated Mr. Russell, bunching up his mouth. &#x201c;Well. Felix works like an old mule, doesn&#x2019;t he?&#x201d; Suddenly, he swung around and glared at me. &#x201c;Tell him, when he comes back, not to forget old friends. You just tell your daddy that, would you?&#x201d; he snapped.<br><br>I took a step backward. &#x201c;Yessir.&#x201d;<br><br>Jottie&#x2019;s little hand closed around mine. &#x201c;Of course we will!&#x201d; she said cheerily. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll tell Felix first thing!&#x201d;<br><br>Mr. Russell waggled his fingers again. &#x201c;Take me on home,&#x201d; he barked to his old Negro servant. &#x201c;You trying to fry me like an egg?&#x201d;<br><br>We watched him go, and Jottie&#x2019;s hand squeezed mine. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go window-shopping,&#x201d; she suggested. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s pretend we&#x2019;ve each got ten dollars, and we have to spend it this afternoon or we&#x2019;ll lose it all.&#x201d;<br><br>So we did, and we were wrangling away about whether I could borrow two of her imaginary dollars for a pink silk dress, when we ran up against Marjorie Lanz. She lived down the street from us, and she talked all the time. She started up before we could even see her. &#x201c;How-you, Jottie?&#x201d; she shouted from inside Vogel&#x2019;s Shoes. &#x201c;Look here at these sandals.&#x201d; She came out, holding a big yellow shoe. &#x201c;How&#x2019;d you like the parade, I thought Elsie looked real pretty, the Rotary could use some new blood, don&#x2019;t you think? Where&#x2019;s Mae and Minerva? Oh hi, honey,&#x201d; she said, catching sight of me. &#x201c;Aren&#x2019;t you just cute as a button?&#x201d;<br><br>I was too old to be cute as a button, but I nodded, being polite.<br><br>Now she was swinging the shoe back and forth. Mr. Vogel was standing nervously in his doorway, waiting to grab her if she walked away with his sandal. Marjorie gabbled on, &#x201c;I heard you&#x2019;re getting yourself a new boarder, Jottie, that&#x2019;s nice, with all those extra rooms you got.&#x201d; I shot a look at Jottie. First I&#x2019;d heard of any new boarder. &#x201c;Who-all you going to get, Jottie? Hope it&#x2019;s someone with more starch in him than Tremendous Wilson, I don&#x2019;t know how you stood that man, is it someone nice?&#x201d; She paused and looked at Jottie expectantly. So did Mr. Vogel. So did I.<br><br>Jottie gazed at Marjorie Lanz for a moment, and then she leaned close. &#x201c;My new boarder is a representative of the United States government,&#x201d; she murmured. She looked suspiciously at Mr. Vogel. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s all I can say.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ooooh.&#x201d; Marjorie clutched the sandal tight. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a secret?&#x201d;<br><br>Jottie nodded regretfully, like she wished she could tell more, and turned toward Mr. Vogel. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s a nice sandal you have there, Mr. Vogel. Does it come in blue?&#x201d; He shook his head no. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s too bad. Well, Marjorie, Willa and I had better be getting along. We have to clean out that new boarder&#x2019;s room. The United States government doesn&#x2019;t like a lot of clutter.&#x201d; She looked at me. &#x201c;They like it neat as a pin. Don&#x2019;t they, Willa?&#x201d; <br><br>Out of pure loyalty, I nodded, and then I waited until we were three storefronts away from Vogel&#x2019;s Shoes before I asked, &#x201c;Are we really getting a new boarder?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, ma&#x2019;am,&#x201d; said Jottie.<br><br>&#x201c;Is he really part of the government?&#x201d;<br><br>She smiled. &#x201c;No. &#x2019;Cause it&#x2019;s not a he.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A lady?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes. A lady.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A lady in the government?&#x201d;<br><br>Jottie raised an eyebrow. &#x201c;Sounds like you don&#x2019;t believe a word I said.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I do,&#x201d; I said slowly. &#x201c;But how come I didn&#x2019;t know about it?&#x201d;<br><br>She reached out to brush my hair away from my face. &#x201c;I thought you did know. Didn&#x2019;t you see me move all those things out of the closet? You were sitting right there on the bed.&#x201d;<br><br>I tried to remember but I couldn&#x2019;t. I&#x2019;d probably been reading.<br><br>I was usually reading.</p><h2>Encounters Unforeseen: 1492 Retold</h2><p><p>After 525 years, the traditional literature recounting the history of Columbus's epic voyage and first encounters with Native Americans remains Eurocentric, focused principally--whether pro- or anti-Columbus--on Columbus and the European perspective. A historical novel, <em>Encounters Unforeseen: 1492 Retold </em>now dramatizes these events from a bicultural perspective, fictionalizing the beliefs, thoughts, and actions of the Native Americans who met Columbus side by side with those of Columbus and other Europeans, all based on a close reading of Columbus's <em>Journal</em>, other primary sources, and anthropological studies.</p><p>The drama alternates among three historic Ta�no chieftains--Caonab�, Guacanagar�, and Guarionex--and a Ta�no youth Columbus captures, Spain's Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand, and Columbus himself. It depicts the education, loves and marriages, and other life experiences each brought to the unforeseen encounters and then their astonishment, fears, and objectives in 1492 and 1493. The focus includes the Ta�no "discovery" of Europe, when Columbus hauls the captive and other Ta�nos back to Spain, as well as the chieftains' reactions to the abusive garrison of seamen Columbus leaves behind in the Caribbean. Throughout, the Ta�no protagonists are neither merely victims nor statistics, but personalities and actors comparable to the European, and their side of the story is forcefully told.</p><p>The novel weaves a fascinating tapestry of scenes and dialogues from the historical record, often incorporating text from primary sources. Isabella plots her dynastic marriage, argues with Ferdinand over who's supreme, and wages war to expand their kingdoms. The chieftains take multiple wives to consolidate their rules, vie to marry the beautiful Anacaona, and battle Caribe raiders. An unknown Columbus conceives a fanciful voyage, marries advantageously to promote it, and yet suffers an agonizing decade of ridicule and rejection. Guacanagar� rescues Columbus when the <em>Santa Mar�a</em> sinks, but Caonab� questions Guacanagar�'s generosity, and Guarionex is vexed, having witnessed a religious prophecy of Ta�no genocide inflicted by a "clothed people." Columbus teaches his captive Christianity, initiating the following centuries' collision of Christianity with Native American religion and spirits.</p><p>The Ta�no stories depict both events known to have occurred (e.g., the chieftains' ascensions to power, the prophecy of genocide, the captive's baptism in Spain) and known practices or experiences (e.g., inter-island canoe travel, a hurricane, a Caribe wife raid, a batey game). The Isabella and Ferdinand stories include their establishment of the Inquisition, subjugation and Christianization of the Canary Islands, completion of the Reconquista, and expulsion of the Jews from Spain, illustrating European doctrines of conquest, enslavement, and involuntary conversion and how the sovereigns ruled over Old World peoples before encountering Native Americans. The Columbus stories portray his pre-1492 sailing experiences and the evolution of his world outlook, and his thoughts during the encounters embody the concepts underlying the European subjugation of Native Americans over the following centuries. Stark societal differences are illustrated, with the Europeans practicing African slavery and the Ta�nos sharing food as communal property.</p><p>A Sources section briefly discusses interpretations of historians and anthropologists contrary to the author's presentation, as well as issues of academic disagreement.</p><p>The result is a gripping, personal, documented, and bicultural portrayal of the voyage that reshaped the course of world history, written at its 525th anniversary.</p></p><p>Andrew Rowen is a U.C. Berkeley and Harvard Law graduate who practiced law as a partner of a major New York City law firm for almost 30 years prior to retiring to write Encounters Unforeseen. He has devoted six years to researching the underlying historical record and visiting nearly all the Caribbean, European, and Atlantic locations where the action takes place, including the archaeological sites where the Ta�no chieftains lived in Haiti and the Dominican Republic. He has long been interested in the roots of religious intolerance. He lives in New York City with his wife and three kids.<p>"Rowen's research...is nothing less than breathtaking. The sensitivity and originality of his portrayals are equally impressive, avoiding the trap of simply retelling a familiar tale from an exclusively European perspective or casting the explorers as nothing more than rapacious colonialists....the tale intelligently captures the religious impulse behind Columbus' adventure...A remarkably new and inventive take on a momentous episode in the 15th century."--<em>Kirkus Reviews</em></p><p>..".spellbinding...Few authors recreate historical worlds and craft characters who feel so real...I particularly enjoyed the way the soul of the Native Americans comes across the narrative. The characters are intriguing, each reflecting a rich culture and a historical background that will excite the reader."--<em>Readers' Favorite </em>Five Star Review</p><p>"An impressively crafted work of riveting fiction from beginning to end, author Andrew Rowen has firmly grounded his truly exceptional novel in historical fact. The result is nothing less than a literary masterpiece that is as deftly complex as it is consistently entertaining."--<em>Midwest Book Review</em></p><p>..".a fascinating story of enmeshed lives, and the consequences of new worlds....written with scrupulous detail to historical accuracy..."--William F. Keegan, Curator of Caribbean Archaeology, Florida Museum of Natural History, <em>Talking Ta�no</em>, <em>Ta�no Indian Myth and Practice </em></p><p>"A must read book for American history, European history, and Native American history! The author, Andrew Rowen has delivered an epic historical account...I can easily see this book becoming required reading in many educational settings....The readers are going to be talking about this book for decades to come!"--<em>Book Review Crew, Authors on the Air</em></p><p>"Amazing! The lives, loves, victories and defeats of the Ta�no Indians are just as meticulously and poignantly brought to life as Columbus, his famous voyage and Queen Isabel's court. A sprawling, globe-trotting, all-consuming tour de force illuminating all sides of the epic cultural clash that created the New World."--Trey Ellis, <em>Platitudes, Home Repairs, Right Here, Right Now</em></p><p>"The story of Europe's first encounters with the Americas has become so fraught and tortured that most people now avoid it, which is a shame, because it is so historically important. With <em>Encounters Unforeseen</em>, this fascinating story becomes human and real. Andrew Rowen has produced a remarkable work - beautifully written, well researched and necessary. A landmark!"--Warren Kozak, <em>LeMay: The Life and Wars of General Curtis LeMay</em></p><p>"An extraordinary combination of scholarship and imagination, Andrew Rowen's <em>Encounters Unforeseen </em>creates a balanced 15th century world, where Caribbean natives and European explorers meet in a painfully evolving historical adventure."--Bartle Bull, <em>The White Rhino Hotel</em>, <em>A Cafe on the Nile</em>.</p></p><h2>Things No One Will Tell Fat Girls: A Handbook for Unapologetic Living</h2><p><i>Things No One Will Tell Fat Girls</i> is a manifesto and call to arms for women of all sizes and ages. With smart and spirited eloquence, veteran blogger Jes Baker calls on women to be proud of their bodies, fight against fat-shaming, and embrace a body-positive worldview to change public perceptions and help women maintain mental health. <br>With the same straightforward tone that catapulted her to national attention when she wrote a public letter addressing the sexist comments of Abercrombie &amp; Fitch's CEO, Jes shares personal experiences along with in-depth research in a way that is approachable, digestible, and empowering. Featuring notable guest authors, <i>Things No One Will Tell Fat Girls</i> is an invitation for all women to reject fat prejudice, learn to love their bodies, and join the most progressive, and life-changing revolution there is: the movement to change the world by loving their bodies.</p><p><b>Jes Baker</b> is a positive, progressive, and magnificently irreverent force to be reckoned with in the realm of self-love advocacy and mental health.<br><br>Jes is internationally recognized for her writing on her blog, <i>The Militant Baker,</i> and for the Attractive and Fat&#x201d; campaign, a response to Abercrombie and Fitch&#x2019;s controversial branding efforts. Her extensive body advocacy work has continued to garner attention from hundreds of national and international media networks.<br><br>When not blogging, Jes spends her time producing the renowned Body Love Conference, speaking at universities, taking pictures in her underwear, writing for several online publications, working with clothing companies to promote more plus size fashion, and trying to convince her cats that they like to wear sweaters and bow ties.

This book is a must read for girls and women of all ages and sizes. I believe this book has to power to change the trajectory of self-loathing for countless females. Bless you, Jes Baker."<br> <b>Ricki Lake</b><br><br>"The first thing readers of this stirring manifesto will notice is that Baker, a blogger and mental health specialist, is very funny. She is also on a mission. As Baker explains, she wants to help women embrace a body-positive view that doesn&#x2019;t put other people down for their size, color, or self-presentation. The book builds on Baker&#x2019;s viral Attractive and Fat campaign, which called out Abercrombie &amp; Fitch for fat shaming. Baker recommends websites, blogs, books, and hotlines for anyone of any gender who&#x2019;s intent on living without self-loathing despite the social pressures around body image. Her message is powerful, particularly her suggestions of things 'fat people' should insist on doing that others often tell them they can&#x2019;t (e.g., sitting in a booth, riding a bike, wearing a bikini). Equally strong are the essays from guest authors, including 'Body Love and Disabilities: Intersections of Identity' by Shanna Katz Kattari and 'The Case for Male Fatshion' by Bruce Sturgell. Readers will be challenged and empowered by Baker&#x2019;s ideas, inspired by her quest to promote body positivity, and entertained by her candid, witty storytelling."<br> <i><b>Publishers Weekly</b></i><br><br> Thank you, Jes Baker.

This book will answer two basic questions: First, what is the extent of the significant research resources you will you miss if you confine your research entirely, or even primarily, to sources available on the open Internet? Second, if you are trying to get a reasonably good overview of the literature on a particular topic, rather than just "something quickly" on it, what are the several alternative methods of subject searching--which are not available on the Web--that are usually much more efficient for that purpose than typing keywords into a blank search box, with the results displayed by relevance-ranking computer algorithms?<br><br>This book shows researchers how to do comprehensive research on any topic. It explains the variety of search mechanisms available, so that the researcher can have the reasonable confidence that s/he has not overlooked something important. This includes not just lists of resources, but discussions of the ways to search within them: how to find the best search terms, how to combine the terms, and how to make the databases (and other sources) show relevant material even when you don't know how to specify the best search terms in advance. The book's overall structuring by nine methods of searching that are applicable in any subject area, rather than by subjects or by types of literature, is unique among guides to research. Also unique is the range and variety of concrete examples of what to do--and of what not to do. <br><br>The book is not "about" the Internet: it is about the best alternatives to the Internet--the sources that are not on the open Web to begin with, that can be found only through research libraries and that are more than ever necessary for any kind of substantive scholarly research. More than any other research guide available, this book directly addresses and provides solutions to the serious problems outlined in recent studies documenting the profound lack of research skills possessed by today's "digital natives."<br></p><p><br><strong>Thomas Mann</strong> has been a general reference librarian in the Main Reading Room of the Library of Congress for more than thirty years.<br><br>"A masterful summary of the main techniques and resources for conducting 'serious' research at postgraduate level and above."--<em>Reference Reviews</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Master Handbook of Acoustics, Sixth Edition</h2><p><p><b>Publisher's Note: Products purchased from Third Party sellers are not guaranteed by the publisher for quality, authenticity, or access to any online entitlements included with the product.</b></p><p><b><br></b></p><p><b>The most complete and current guide to architectural acoustics principles and practices</b></p><p>Design and construct audiophile-quality sonic environments of all sizes--from home theaters and project studios to large-scale recording studios.

Suitable for advanced undergraduates and graduate students in mathematics, it employs the language and notation of informal mathematics. There are very few displayed theorems; most of the facts are stated in simple terms, followed by a sketch of the proof. Only a few exercises are designated as such since the book itself is an ongoing series of exercises with hints. The treatment covers the basic concepts of set theory, cardinal numbers, transfinite methods, and a good deal more in&nbsp;25 brief chapters. <br>"This book is a very specialized but broadly useful introduction to set theory. It is aimed at 'the beginning student of advanced mathematics' ... who wants to understand the set-theoretic underpinnings of the mathematics he already knows or will learn soon. It is also useful to the professional mathematician who knew these underpinnings at one time but has now forgotten exactly how they go. ... A good reference for how set theory is used in other parts of mathematics." &#x2014; Allen Stenger, <i>The Mathematical Association of America,</i> September 2011.</p><p>Hungarian-born Paul R. Halmos (1916&#x2013;2006) is widely regarded as a top-notch expositor of mathematics. He taught at the University of Chicago and the University of Michigan as well as other universities and made significant contributions to several areas of mathematics including mathematical logic, probability theory, ergodic theory, and functional analysis.<p>From the reviews:</p><p>&#x201c;This book is a very specialized but broadly useful introduction to set theory.

First published in 1961, this remarkable collection is a testament to a philosopher whom many consider to be one of the most influential thinkers of the twentieth century. This is an essential introduction to the brilliance of Bertrand Russell.</p></p><p><p>Bertrand Russell (1872&#x2013;1970) was one of the most formidable thinkers of the modern era. A philosopher, mathematician, educational innovator, champion of intellectual, social and sexual freedom, and a campaigner for peace and human rights, he was also a prolific writer of popular and influential books, essays and lectures on an extensive range of subjects. </p> <p></p> <p>Considered to be one of the most controversial figures of the twentieth century, Bertrand Russell is widely renowned for his provocative writings. These definitive works offer profound insights and forward-thinking perspectives on a changing western society progressively shaped, most significantly, by two world wars, the decline of British imperialism and an evolving moral landscape. </p> <p></p></p><h2>Stop Being Mean to Yourself: A Story About Finding The True Meaning of Self-Love</h2><p><b><i>Stop Being Mean to Yourself</i> is a compassionate guide filled with new ideas for overcoming the pitfalls of guilt and self-doubt, and helps readers find a happier place in the world.</b><br><br>"In this wonderfully practical book, Melody Beattie gives you the tools to discover the magnificence and splendor of your being." -- Deepak Chopra, M.D.<br> <br>Beckoning readers toward a spiritual territory beyond even that of her revolutionary best-seller <i>Codependent No More,</i> Melody Beattie conducts us through teeming Casablanca, war-torn Algeria, and the caverns of Egypt's great pyramids as she embarks on a new kind of journey of the soul.<br> <br>An enlightening blend of travel adventure and spiritual discovery, filled with new ideas for overcoming the pitfalls of guilt and self-doubt, <i>Stop Being Mean to Yourself</i> is a compassionate tour guide for the troubled and the heartsick, for those who seek a happier place in the world. A tale that is at once modern and timeless, rich with the promise of personal discovery, it is a book about learning the art of living and of loving others -- and ourselves. As full of suspense and excitement as it is of hope and encouragement, it is as rewarding for its pure reading pleasure as for the wisdom it imparts.</p><p>Using the unlikely backdrop of Northern Africa, Melody Beattie (author of <i>Co-Dependent No More</i>) blends the genres of travel adventure and spiritual quest. Traveling mishaps such as being led unknowingly into the souk of Cairo (rumored to be a clandestine marketplace of no return), become metaphors for learning how to let go of fear while still honoring your instincts. Interrogations at border crossings symbolize the self-examination we must endure before crossing over to a new stage of enlightenment. Fortunately, this is not a U.S.-centric travelogue. In war-ravaged Algiers, Beattie diligently pursues the truth of its people rather than her own reactions to poverty and terrorism. Despite its pop-psychology title, this is a book of impressive depth, exploring the global challenge of loving thy neighbor as well as thy self.In addiction and recovery circles, Melody Beattie is a household name. She is the best-selling author of numerous books, including <i>Codependent No More, Beyond Codependency, The Language of Letting Go, More Language of Letting Go,</i> and <i>52 Weeks of Conscious Contact.</i> Her first book, <i>Codependent No More,</i> was published by Hazelden in 1986. Melody's compassionate and insightful look into codependency--the concept of losing oneself in the name of helping another--struck a universal chord among families struggling with a loved one's addiction. Twenty years later, the concepts continue to ring true for millions worldwide, as the book has sold more than four million copies and has been translated into more than a dozen languages. Melody currently has 13 titles with Hazelden and several more with other publishers.&nbsp; For more information about Melody and her books, visit www.melodybeattie.com.</p><h2>The Swim Coaching Bible, Volume I (The Coaching Bible)</h2><p><p><i>The Swim Coaching Bible</i> offers you an all-star, international cast of swimming experts sharing their knowledge on producing the most successful individual athletes and teams in the sport.

I think we&#x2019;d enjoyed the meal so much we hoped Elaine would serve us the whole thing all over again. These were people we&#x2019;ve gotten to know a little from Elaine&#x2019;s volunteer work&#x2014;nobody from my work, nobody from the ad agency. We sat around in the living room describing the loudest sounds we&#x2019;d ever heard. One said it was his wife&#x2019;s voice when she told him she didn&#x2019;t love him anymore and wanted a divorce. Another recalled the pounding of his heart when he suffered a coronary. Tia Jones had become a grandmother at the age of thirty-seven and hoped never again to hear anything so loud as her granddaughter crying in her sixteen-year-old daughter&#x2019;s arms. Her husband Ralph said it hurt his ears whenever his brother opened his mouth in public, because his brother had Tourette syndrome and erupted with remarks like &#x201c;I masturbate! Your penis smells good!&#x201d; in front of perfect strangers on a bus, or during a movie, or even in church.<br><br>Young Chris Case reversed the direction and introduced the topic of silences. He said the most silent thing he&#x2019;d ever heard was the land mine taking off his right leg outside Kabul, Afghanistan.<br><br>As for other silences, nobody contributed. In fact, there came a silence now. Some of us hadn&#x2019;t realized that Chris had lost a leg. He limped, but only slightly. I didn&#x2019;t even know he&#x2019;d fought in Afghanistan. &#x201c;A land mine?&#x201d; I said.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, sir. A land mine.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Can we see it?&#x201d; Deirdre said.<br><br>&#x201c;No, ma&#x2019;am,&#x201d; Chris said. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t carry land mines around on my person.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No! I mean your leg.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It was blown off.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I mean the part that&#x2019;s still there!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll show you,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;if you kiss it.&#x201d;<br><br>Shocked laughter. We started talking about the most ridiculous things we&#x2019;d ever kissed. Nothing of interest. We&#x2019;d all kissed only people, and only in the usual places. &#x201c;All right, then,&#x201d; Chris told Deirdre, &#x201c;here&#x2019;s your chance for the conversation&#x2019;s most unique entry.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, I don&#x2019;t want to kiss your leg!&#x201d;<br><br>Although none of us showed it, I think we all felt a little irritated with Deirdre. We all wanted to see.<br><br>Morton Sands was there too that night, and for the most part he&#x2019;d managed to keep quiet. Now he said, &#x201c;Jesus Christ, Deirdre.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, well. Okay,&#x201d; she said.<br><br>Chris pulled up his right pant leg, bunching the cuff about halfway up his thigh, and detached his prosthesis, a device of chromium bars and plastic belts strapped to his knee, which was intact and swiveled upward horribly to present the puckered end of his leg. Deirdre got down on her bare knees before him, and he hitched forward in his seat&#x2014;the couch, Ralph Jones was sitting beside him&#x2014;to move the scarred stump within two inches of Deirdre&#x2019;s face. Now she started to cry. Now we were all embarrassed, a little ashamed.<br><br>For nearly a minute, we waited.<br><br>Then Ralph Jones said, &#x201c;Chris, I remember when I saw you fight two guys at once outside the Aces Tavern. No kidding,&#x201d; Jones told the rest of us, &#x201c;he went outside with these two guys and beat the crap out of both of them.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I guess I could&#x2019;ve given them a break,&#x201d; Chris said. &#x201c;They were both pretty drunk.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Chris, you sure kicked some ass that night.&#x201d;<br><br>In the pocket of my shirt I had a wonderful Cuban cigar. I wanted to step outside with it. The dinner had been one of our best, and I wanted to top off the experience with a satisfying smoke. But you want to see how this sort of thing turns out. How often will you witness a woman kissing an amputation? Jones, however, had ruined everything by talking. He&#x2019;d broken the spell. Chris worked the prosthesis back into place and tightened the straps and rearranged his pant leg. Deirdre stood up and wiped her eyes and smoothed her skirt and took her seat, and that was that. The outcome of all this was that Chris and Deirdre, about six months later, down at the courthouse, in the presence of very nearly the same group of friends, were married by a magistrate. Yes, they&#x2019;re husband and wife. You and I know what goes on.<br><br>Accomplices<br><br>Another silence comes to mind. A couple of years ago Elaine and I had dinner at the home of Miller Thomas, formerly the head of my agency in Manhattan. Right&#x2014;he and his wife Francesca ended up out here too, but considerably later than Elaine and I&#x2014;once my boss, now a San Diego retiree. We finished two bottles of wine with dinner, maybe three bottles. After dinner we had brandy. Before dinner we had cocktails. We didn&#x2019;t know each other particularly well, and maybe we used the liquor to rush past that fact. After the brandy I started drinking scotch, and Miller drank bourbon, and, although the weather was warm enough that the central air conditioner was running, he pronounced it a cold night and lit a fire in his fireplace. It took only a squirt of fluid and the pop of a match to get an armload of sticks crackling and blazing, and then he laid on a couple of large chunks he said were good, seasoned oak. &#x201c;The capitalist at his forge,&#x201d; Francesca said.<br><br>At one point we were standing in the light of the flames, I and Miller Thomas, seeing how many books each man could balance on his outflung arms, Elaine and Francesca loading them onto our hands in a test of equilibrium which both of us failed repeatedly. It became a test of strength. I don&#x2019;t know who won. We called for more and more books, and our women piled them on until most of Miller&#x2019;s library lay around us on the floor. He had a small Marsden Hartley canvas mounted above the mantel, a crazy, mostly blue landscape done in oil, and I said that perhaps that wasn&#x2019;t the place for a painting like this one, so near the smoke and heat, such an expensive painting. And the painting was masterly, too, from what I could see of it by dim lamps and firelight, amid books scattered all over the floor . . . Miller took offense. He said he&#x2019;d paid for this masterpiece, he owned it, he could put it where it suited him. He moved very near the flames and took down the painting and turned to us holding it before him and declared that he could even, if he wanted, throw it in the fire and leave it there. &#x201c;Is it art? Sure. But listen,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;art doesn&#x2019;t own it. My name ain&#x2019;t Art.&#x201d; He held the canvas flat like a tray, landscape up, and tempted the flames with it, thrusting it in and out . . . And the strange thing is that I&#x2019;d heard a nearly identical story about Miller Thomas and his beloved Hartley landscape some years before, about an evening very similar to this one, the drinks and wine and brandy and more drinks, the rowdy conversation, the scattering of books, and finally Miller thrusting this painting toward the flames and calling it his own property and threatening to burn it. On that previous night his guests had talked him down from the heights, and he&#x2019;d hung the painting back in its place, but on our night&#x2014;why?&#x2014;none of us found a way to object as he added his property to the fuel and turned his back and walked away. A black spot appeared on the canvas and spread out in a sort of smoking puddle that gave rise to tiny flames. Miller sat in a chair across the living room, by the flickering window, and observed from that distance with a drink in his hand. Not a word, not a move, from any of us. The wooden frame popped marvelously in the silence while the great painting cooked away, first black and twisted, soon gray and fluttering, and then the fire had it all.<br><br>Ad Man<br><br>This morning I was assailed by such sadness at the velocity of life&#x2014;the distance I&#x2019;ve traveled from my own youth, the persistence of the old regrets, the new regrets, the ability of failure to freshen itself in novel forms&#x2014;that I almost crashed the car. Getting out at the place where I do the job I don&#x2019;t feel I&#x2019;m very good at, I grabbed my briefcase too roughly and dumped half of its contents in my lap and half in the parking lot, and while gathering it all up I left my keys on the seat and locked the car manually&#x2014;an old man&#x2019;s habit&#x2014;and trapped them in the RAV.<br><br>In the office, I asked Shylene to call a locksmith and then get me an appointment with my back-man.<br><br>In the upper right quadrant of my back I have a nerve that once in a while gets pinched. The T4 nerve. These nerves aren&#x2019;t frail little ink lines; they&#x2019;re cords as thick as your pinky finger. This one gets caught between tense muscles, and for days, even for weeks, there&#x2019;s not much to be done but take aspirins and get massages and visit the chiropractor. Down my right arm I feel a tingling, a numbness, sometimes a dull, sort of muffled torment, or else a shapeless, confusing pain.<br><br>It&#x2019;s a signal: it happens when I&#x2019;m anxious about something.<br><br>To my surprise, Shylene knew all about this something. Apparently she finds time to be Googling her bosses, and she&#x2019;d learned of an award I was about to receive in, of all places, New York&#x2014;for an animated television commercial. The award goes to my old New York team, but I was the only one of us attending the ceremony, possibly the only one interested, so many years down the line. This little gesture of acknowledgment put the finishing touches on a depressing picture. The people on my team had gone on to other teams, fancier agencies, higher accomplishments. All I&#x2019;d done in better than two decades was to tread forward until I reached the limit of certain assumptions, and step off. Meanwhile, Shylene was oohing, gushing, like a proud nurse who expects you to marvel at all the unholy procedures the hospital has in store for you. I said to her, &#x201c;Thanks, thanks.&#x201d;<br><br>When I entered the reception area, and throughout this transaction, Shylene wore a flashy sequined carnival masque. I didn&#x2019;t ask why.<br><br>Our office environment is part of the new wave. The whole agency works under one gigantic big top like a circus&#x2014;not crowded, quite congenial, all of it surrounding a spacious break-time area with pinball machines and a basketball hoop, and every Friday during the summer months we have a Happy Hour with free beer from a keg.<br><br>In New York I made commercials. In San Diego I write and design glossy brochures, mostly for a group of western resorts where golf is played and horses take you along bridle paths. Don&#x2019;t get me wrong&#x2014;California&#x2019;s full of beautiful spots; it&#x2019;s a pleasure to bring them to the attention of people who might enjoy them. Just, please, not with a badly pinched nerve.<br><br>When I can&#x2019;t stand it I take the day off and visit the big art museum in Balboa Park. Today, after the locksmith got me back in my car, I drove to the museum and sat in on part of a lecture in one of its side-rooms, a woman Outsider artist raving, &#x201c;Art is man and man is art!&#x201d; I listened for five minutes, and what little of it she managed to make comprehensible didn&#x2019;t even merit being called shallow. Just the same, her paintings were slyly designed, intricately patterned, and coherent. I wandered from wall to wall, taking some of it in, not much. But looking at art for an hour or so always changes the way I see things afterward&#x2014;this day, for instance, a group of mentally handicapped adults on a tour of the place with their twisted, hovering hands and cocked heads, moving among the works like cheap cinema zombies, but good zombies, zombies with minds and souls and things to keep them interested. And outside, where they normally have a lot of large metal sculptures, the grounds were being dug up and reconstructed&#x2014;a dragline shovel nosing the rubble monstrously, and a woman and child watching, motionless, the little boy standing on a bench with his smile and sideways eyes and his mother beside him, holding his hand, both so still, like a photograph of American ruin.<br><br>Next I had a session with a chiropractor dressed up as an elf.<br><br>It seemed the entire staff at the medical complex near my house were costumed for Halloween, and while I waited out front in the car for my appointment, the earliest one I could get that day, I saw a Swiss milkmaid coming back from lunch, then a witch with a green face, then a sunburst-orange superhero. Then I had the session with the chiropractor in his tights and drooping cap.<br><br>As for me? My usual guise. The masquerade continues.<br><br>Farewell<br><br>Elaine got a wall phone for the kitchen, a sleek blue one that wears its receiver like a hat, with a caller ID readout on its face just below the keypad. While I eyeballed this instrument, having just come in from my visit with the chiropractor, a brisk, modest tone began, and the tiny screen showed ten digits I didn&#x2019;t recognize. My inclination was to scorn it like any other unknown. But this was the first call, the inaugural message.<br><br>As soon as I touched the receiver I wondered if I&#x2019;d regret this, if I was holding a mistake in my hand, if I was pulling this mistake to my head and saying &#x201c;Hello&#x201d; to it.<br><br>The caller was my first wife, Virginia, or Ginny, as I&#x2019;d always called her. We&#x2019;d been married long ago, in our early twenties, and put a stop to it after three crazy years. Since then we hadn&#x2019;t spoken, we&#x2019;d had no reason to, but now we had one. Ginny was dying.<br><br>Her voice came faintly. She told me the doctors had closed the book on her, she&#x2019;d ordered her affairs, the good people from hospice were in attendance.<br><br>Before she ended this earthly transit, as she called it, Ginny wanted to shed any kind of bitterness against certain people, certain men, especially me. She said how much she&#x2019;d been hurt, and how badly she wanted to forgive me, but she didn&#x2019;t know whether she could or not&#x2014;she hoped she could&#x2014;and I assured her, from the abyss of a broken heart, that I hoped so too, that I hated my infidelities and my lies about the money, and the way I&#x2019;d kept my boredom secret, and my secrets in general, and Ginny and I talked, after forty years of silence, about the many other ways I&#x2019;d stolen her right to the truth.</p><h2>Klingon for the Galactic Traveler (Star Trek)</h2><p><i>"Heghlu'meH QaQ jajvam."</i><br> <br>"It is a good day to die."<br> <br>What is the proper response to this?

Not only do they continue to live in our midst, but, as historian Scott Poole shows, these monsters are an important part of our past&#x2015;a hideous obsession America cannot seem to escape.<br> <br>Poole&#x2019;s central argument in <i>Monsters in America</i> is that monster tales intertwine with America&#x2019;s troubled history of racism, politics, class struggle, and gender inequality. The second edition of <i>Monsters</i> leads readers deeper into America&#x2019;s tangled past to show how monsters continue to haunt contemporary American ideology.</p><p>By adding new discussions of the American West, Poole focuses intently on the Native American experience. He reveals how monster stories went west to Sand Creek and Wounded Knee, bringing the preoccupation with monsters into the twentieth century through the American Indian Movement. In his new preface and expanded conclusion, Poole&#x2019;s tale connects to the present&#x2015;illustrating the relationship between current social movements and their historical antecedents. This proven textbook also studies the social location of contemporary horror films, exploring, for example, how <i>Get Out</i> emerged from the context of the Black Lives Matter movement. Finally, in the new section "American Carnage," Poole challenges readers to assess what their own monster tales might be and how our sordid past horrors express themselves in our present cultural anxieties.</p><p>By the end of the book, Poole cautions that America&#x2019;s monsters aren&#x2019;t going away anytime soon. If specters of the past still haunt our present, they may yet invade our future. Monsters are here to stay.</p></p><p><p>W.

Yet already, his influence as a theologian was felt not only in Germany, but throughout the world. His interactions with the Psalms reveal a passionate heart and brilliant mind grappling with the Bible&#x2019;s eternal truths and their application to human nature and temporal realities. Dietrich Bonhoeffer&#x2019;s Meditations on Psalms is vintage Bonhoeffer: eloquent, incisive, encouraging, challenging, inviting us to find in the Psalms both a path toward repose in God and a call to Christlike living and practical action as followers of the Lord Jesus. Also available Dietrich Bonhoeffer&#x2019;s Prison Poems Dietrich Bonhoeffer&#x2019;s Christmas Sermons</p></p><p>Dietrich Bonhoeffer (1906 - 1945) was a major writer and thinker in Germany between the wars. His many books of theology are still read and as influential among contemporary evangelical believers as the works of C.S. Lewis and Billy Graham: such works as The Cost of Discipleship, Letters and Papers from Prison, Ethics, Life Together, and Christ the Center. In 1939 he refused to take the loyalty oath to Adolf Hitler. Shortly after, he was invited to participate in a plot to assassinate Hitler. He was eventually caught, imprisoned, and executed.<br><br><p>Translator and editor, Edwin H. Robertson was born in London, England, in 1912, of Scottish parents. For many years he was involved in broadcasting and communications. He is the author of a number of books, notably on the Bible, broadcasting, and Dietrich Bonhoeffer. He is the minister of Heath Street Baptist Church in Hampstead, London, England.</p>Dietrich Bonhoeffer&#39;s Meditations on Psalms Sermon to the Preachers&#39; Seminar Berlin, May 20, 1926 Psalm 127 ON DIETRICH BONHOEFFER&#39;S TWENTIETH BIRTHDAY, February 4, 1926, he was a senior theology student at the University of Berlin. This was his third year. He had previously studied in Tubingen and, with his brother, taken a three-month tour of Rome and North Africa. The importance of this visit was his discovery of the power and beauty of the Roman Liturgy in Holy Week. It did nothing, however, to change his theological objections to Rome. On May 20, he delivered the following sermon on Psalm 127 at the preachers&#39; seminary. He was quite aware of the secluded life of the seminary and the turmoil of Berlin outside its walls, where Fascists and Communists fought in the streets. After its defeat in the Great War, Germany, a once-proud nation, had been forced to sign the hated Versailles Treaty. Inflation was rampant and unemployment had reached an unprecedented peak. An unpopular government in Weimar cared little for the church and seemed unable to govern the state. The more sober elements in the German population put their heads down and worked all hours for low pay to rebuild the nation. Bonhoeffer found Psalm 127 to be a very timely word for a desperate nation. PSALM 127 Unless the LORD builds the house, its builders labor in vain. Unless the LORD watches over the city, the watchmen stand guard in vain. In vain you rise early and stay up late, toiling for food to eat--- for he grants sleep to those he loves. Sons are a heritage from the LORD, children a reward from him. Like arrows in the hands of a warrior are sons born in one&#39;s youth. Blessed is the man whose quiver is full of them. They will not be put to shame when they contend with their enemies in the gate. Sermon to the Preachers&#39; Seminar We live in a time when more than ever before we speak and must speak of building and rebuilding. We speak of how our commerce must grow and what trade agreements will bring about this result today or tomorrow, as quickly as possible. We speak of the best arrangements on workers&#39; wages and how workers and employers alike can find a common interest in success. We ask ourselves how we can begin to become once more a rich, troublefree, happy, and respected people. We work today as perhaps we have never worked before to achieve that goal as soon as possible. We all want to do our best to add our one stone to this building. God knows there are others who do not think like this. Let us pray to God that he restores their sight! But we speak here only of those who use the word &#39;building&#39; seriously, who really put their life and their working strength into it. And of these, there truly are many, very many. Woe betide us if we are not among them! With the question of commerce, there is another question, closely associated with it---the social question! How much this is talked about and how much is already being done! And we thank those men and women who dedicate themselves to this and do fruitful work. And every one of us here would wish to belong to this band of men and women who take seriously love of their neighbor in this work. Woe betide our Christianity if we do not do this. The people should be rich, healthy, and strong. To this end, the scientists sit from morning to night at their benches, in their institutes, and with their apparatus. Science, technology--- they all work toward building the future. Take up any newspaper and read the print or between the lines and you will hear the word, loud and clear: build, build! So far as we speak of really serious people, they want not only to be rich and respected but a people who are healthy in body and soul. We provide the young people of our cities with opportunities to explore, to dance, and to play. We rejoice that they go out into the countryside instead of seeking their pleasures in dirty and undesirable places in the cities. We speak much more of moral rebuilding, without which nothing can happen, and know that such cannot come about unless each of us begins with his own personal moral building. There are many men and women who see their vocation in the moral training of our youth. They work at it with all their strength and do not complain but are proud of their calling. We are lucky to have such people! And should we not all, so far as we can, have at least a small part of this work? Woe betide us if it is not so! Otherwise we are truly only Sunday Christians, from 9:00 to 10:00 in the morning! But let us hear the words of the Psalms: &#39;Unless the LORD builds the house . . .&#39; Anyone who hears these words aright sees in them judgment over all times of frantic building and over all times of secure possession. If only the hands of men build and the Lord does not build, there is nothing. There are only two things that we must fully understand: &#39;Unless the LORD builds&#39; and &#39;its builders labor in vain.&#39; But what does it mean that God should build? Is there on earth a building, a house, a city, that has fallen from heaven, that was not built by men? Does this verse mean that we have to wait until such a miracle happens? If all our building is in vain, really in vain, which means &#39;of no value,&#39; why do we begin to rebuild what has been destroyed instead of waiting for God to build? Why do we continue to work to establish the church where once it belonged? Why do we struggle for the moral and religious education of our children, if all we do is in vain? In this way, many may argue if they take the words &#39;in vain&#39; seriously. And yet, another voice is raised and with comfort says: Certainly, all our doing is in vain if we do only what we want to do. Then we can hope for nothing. But when we are most careful to do what God wants and not what we want, then it is as though the Lord himself builds. For how else can the Lord build except through us? It is only when we build other than in the spirit of the Lord that our very best work is in vain. People who talk like that are certainly right. Woe betide us if we do not go to work with our full strength and goodwill! But are we really agreeing with those who say that when we build with our very best endeavor, it is the same as if the Lord builds? Must there not be with this building of the Lord another explanation than simply our piety and goodwill? None of us can doubt that many are building with the highest motives and with all their strength. Do we want then to say that here God is at work? Here, where only men are involved? Are we then to claim that so long as we have goodwill, God&#39;s action is unnecessary? Are we so blind that we do not see that all our work always carries the scars of the past, the signs of sinfulness? Do we no longer see that we are in the world and remain only with our own ideas, even the most pious of us? That we cannot do God&#39;s will unless God wills it? That we cannot say yes to God&#39;s will, if God has not said yes to us? Yes, it is so! We fail to see the danger of raising a new Tower of Babel, from which we say that we have raised it to heaven ourselves, that now we no longer need the work of God, but our own will can take the place of that. We really believe that we have done all and enough with our work of religion and moral renewal. And we never think that there is something else to be said: &#39;It is good,&#39; as good as we are. All we would say is, &#39;We all want with all our heart to be a rich, happy people, and each to be a good, happy person, and have a merciful God.&#39; Ah! This is not something we can give ourselves, nor can we believe it possible by ourselves.</p><h2>Vulcan&#39;s Hammer</h2><p>After the twentieth century&#x2019;s devastating series of wars, the world&#x2019;s governments banded together into one globe-spanning entity, committed to peace at all costs. Ensuring that peace is the Vulcan supercomputer, responsible for all major decisions. But some people don&#x2019;t like being taken out of the equation. And others resent the idea that the Vulcan is taking the place of God. As the world grows ever closer to all-out war, one functionary frantically tries to prevent it. But the Vulcan computer has its own plans, plans that might not include humanity at all.</p><p>Objective, unbiased and hyperrational, the Vulcan 3 should have been the perfect ruler. The omnipotent computer dictates policy that is in the best interests of all citizens&#x2014;or at least, that is the idea. But when the machine, whose rule evolved out of chaos and war, begins to lose control of the &#x201c;Healer&#x201d; movement of religious fanatics and the mysterious force behing their rebellion, all Hell breaks loose. <br>Written in 1960, Philip K. Dick&#x2019;s paranoid novel imagines a totalitarian state in which hammer-headed robots terrorize citizens and freedom is an absurd joke. William Barrios, the morally conflicted hero, may be the only person who can prevent the battle for control from destroying the world&#x2014;if, that is, he can decide which side he&#x2019;s on.<br><br>Winner of both the Hugo and John W. Campbell awards for best novel, widely regarded as the premiere science fiction writer of his day, and the object of cult-like adoration from his legions of fans, Philip K. Dick has come to be seen in a literary light that defies classification in much the same way as Borges and Calvino. With breathtaking insight, he utilizes vividly unfamiliar worlds to evoke the hauntingly and hilariously familiar in our society and ourselves.<p>Over a writing career that spanned three decades, PHILIP K. DICK (1928&#x2013;1982) published 36 science fiction novels and 121 short stories in which he explored the essence of what makes man human and the dangers of centralized power. Toward the end of his life, his work turned toward deeply personal, metaphysical questions concerning the nature of God. Eleven novels and short stories have been adapted to film,&nbsp;notably&nbsp;<i>Blade Runner</i> (based on <i>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?</i>), <i>Total Recall,</i><i>Minority Report,</i> and <i>A Scanner Darkly. </i>The recipient of critical acclaim and numerous awards throughout his career, Dick was inducted into the&nbsp;Science Fiction&nbsp;Hall of Fame in 2005, and in 2007 the Library of America published a selection of his novels in three volumes. His work has been translated into&nbsp;more than twenty-five&nbsp;languages.</p></p><h2>The Beast&#39;s Heart: A Novel of Beauty and the Beast</h2><p><b>A luxuriously magical retelling of <i>Beauty and the Beast</i> set in seventeenth-century France&#x2014;and told from the point of view of the Beast himself.</b><br><br><i>I am neither monster nor man&#x2014;yet I am both.&nbsp;I am the Beast.</i><br><br>He is a broken, wild thing, his heart&#x2019;s nature exposed by his beastly form.

They each beguile the mind and confuse the senses with wonder and strangeness so all that was familiar becomes<br> freakish, and the most bizarre of things intimate and natural. For the longest time after the curse fell, I did not know if I was a beast who dreamed of being a man, or a man who dreamed he was a beast.<br> There are moments I recall with clarity from that dark stretch of years in which I lost myself. In remembering them, though, the real is indistinguishable from the phantasm. My initial flight in abject terror from my home is as sharp and shape- less as a shard of glass. I know it happened. Everything since has unfolded from it. The details, though, are the stuff of night- mares.<br> I have tried to string my memories together to make some sense of those years. But living under such an enchantment is akin to being trapped in the grip of a restless slumber, fighting toward wakefulness and finding only dreams locked within dreams.<br>&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>2</i> <br> &nbsp;<br> The first moment I felt as though I were awake, in all those years, was the first time I saw Isabeau, standing in a fall of golden light, hesitating on my doorstep in her poor, patched gown. The sun flooded in, spilling across the flagstones and lighting up the very air around her. It was too bright for me. Her radiance daz- zled my sleep-blighted eyes and I crept away to hide.<br> Everything before that has faded into shadow, or taken on the livid shimmer of a half-remembered delusion. The decades I spent haunting the wild, wild forests my fair lands had become, terrifying people and savaging any livestock foolish enough to stray within its bounds; the starvation years that inevitably fol- lowed, as the forest emptied of all living creatures save vermin and the occasional watchful raven; the shatteringly lonely term of my imprisonment in the home I eventually returned to when my misery finally crushed my rage and I remembered what I once had been.<br> If it was a living nightmare that took me into the forest, it was most certainly a dream that brought me out of it, and back to my ancestral home.<br> Since I had forgotten myself, my dreams had been wild, primal things, a reflection of the savagery that filled my days. But, as the skin sunk deeper into the hollows between my ribs and my empty belly cleaved to my spine, I lost even the strength to run and hunt in my imagination. Now, each night found me limping through the endless, empty forest in my mind, search- ing and searching. I had no clear idea of what it was I searched for, except that, unlike during my waking hours, it was not food. My memories of those bitter dreams are of hunting through dark, shadowy trees for something hidden in the heart of the forest; something I feared to discover, but I feared more I would never find, and would be lost to me forever. <br><br>&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>3</i><br> &nbsp;<br>One grim night, as I was nearing the end of my strength, I fell asleep upon a bed of pine needles, curled against the rain soaking through the branches above. At once my mind found itself slinking between the measureless ranks of phantom trees. As I dragged my paws forward, I saw ahead a glimmer of moon- light. I lifted my weary head. The moon never pierced the can- opy of this unending nightmare.<br> As I looked, the pale gleam began to move. I followed. I was so far behind, and so weak and sore of foot, it was all I could do to keep the errant moonbeam in sight. But eventually, I began to draw closer and I could see I was following a woman. She was dressed in the most exquisite finery, such as would not be out of place at the royal court, and she moved as lightly through the trees as if she were stepping across a dance floor. Her pale skirts were long and trailing, and shone in the gloom. She wore a tall, old-fashioned, horned headdress, from which a gossamer veil floated, dissolving behind her into drifting motes of silver light that sunk away into the dark soil of the forest path. She was a vision so rich and rare, I could not help but follow along behind.<br> I soon realized we were walking upon a road that wound through the forest. It was ancient and much degraded, its cob- bles displaced by roots and covered by moss. Indeed, parts of it were in danger of being entirely reclaimed by the creeping wood.<br> Eventually she stopped ahead of me. I came as close as I dared. She was standing before a ruined gate. It had once been very grand indeed, but now ivy twisted through its rusted iron- work, and the stone columns supporting it were crumbling and broken. I did not like to look at the gate; to do so made me feel miserable and afraid. So instead, I looked at her.<br> Now I had come upon her, I saw her dress was not, as I had thought, a sumptuous court gown of satin and brocade. Up <br><br>&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>4</i> <br> &nbsp;<br> close, I could see it was constructed of clotted cobweb and the velvet wings of dead moths. It was not embroidered with pearls and diamonds, but decorated with the tiny bones of small ani- mals and glittering with spiders&#x2019; eyes. The veil was no veil, but a drifting cloud of tiny insects glimmering with their own milky iridescence. I hunched down, my hackles rising in fear, and she turned to look at me.<br> I could not see her expression, but her eyes gleamed in the darkness, green as a cat&#x2019;s. Terrified, I hid my face.<br> When I looked again, the gate was open and she was some distance away from me, walking between the cracked columns. I did not want to put my paws through that gate, but as my eyes followed her, my gaze fell upon the dark, jagged shape of a ru- ined building far ahead. Something about its lightless, mis- shapen hulk called to me and I crept forward.<br> I lost sight of the woman for some minutes, then, as I slunk along the overgrown path, I spied her again. She was no longer ahead of me, but walking far away, to the side of the ruin ahead. I hesitated, unsure if I should follow her, or my growing compul- sion to see what lay amid the broken walls. By the light of the ghostly glimmer she cast about herself, I saw her walk beneath an archway in a tall hedge. I could see nothing but trees beyond. My heart quailed. What could lie through that portal, but the forest? I did not want to go back there. I turned away from the fading smudge of light and started again toward the shattered building looming distantly against the night sky.<br> The path twisted to and fro among strange, dark shapes vastly different to any forest tree I had seen, and yet eerily famil- iar. With every step I took, a sense of creeping unease grew in my breast. Then the path made another twist and before me lay the ruined chateau I had seen from the gate. <br><br>&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>5</i><br> &nbsp;<br>Within its roofless, crumbling walls, burning brands illumi- nated a scene of the basest debauchery. Bodies writhed and danced and crawled around the figure of a man, who stood among them, his shirt open and his hair wild. In his hand he held a bottle glint- ing amber in the firelight. His eyes shone with a mad light, and his face was gray with the ravages of illness.<br> Pain lanced through my heart.<br> I knew him. I hated him. The anger I thought had died erupted into incandescence within me and I sprang forward, snarling.<br> But my claws and teeth met with nothing. I crashed heavily upon the stone floor and lay, writhing and alone, amid the cold, dark ruin of the house in which I had been raised.<br> Memories came flooding back. A confused and bitter ca- cophony, with rage and hatred at its heart. I threw back my head to howl, but the sound that came out was a human scream.<br> I jerked awake.<br> I was in the forest. My hairy paws scrabbled in the sodden mulch as I heaved myself upright.<br> Nothing had changed. Everything had changed.<br> I was still a broken, starving beast&#x2014;but I remembered now. I remembered what I had been, and how I had been transformed. I remembered the Fairy&#x2019;s cold, green eyes. <i>Let all who look upon you see the nature of the heart beating in your breast, </i>was the curse she had laid upon me. And only now, with my arrogance crushed and my rage exhausted, could I begin to see the truth of her words.<br> But what good was any of it now? I was alone and close to death.<br> I hung my head. At my feet, a pale, wet rock glistened in the darkness. It was a curious, regular shape. Not far from it lay another, so similar as to be identical. I looked around. A short<br>&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>6</i> <br> &nbsp;<br> distance away, the rain had washed a film of dirt and mulch from the ragged edge of a ruined, cobbled road. My hackles rose as fear gripped me.<br> Was I still dreaming? I was so sure I was awake.<br> I stepped forward, sniffing. There was an odd tang in the air. It took me a few moments to place the scent. Magic. I don&#x2019;t know how I knew it, but I realized now the scent had pervaded the forest as long as I had lived in it. Until now, however, the magic had been old and settled. This was fresh and new.<br> With sudden clarity, I knew I was not dreaming. The road was real, and I knew where it would take me, if I chose to fol- low it.<br> I could, of course, choose not to. I could slink away into the forest and ignore it. Without a doubt, that would have spelled my death. I did not feel ready to take the path. I did not feel ready to return. But with death as the alternative, my formless fears were no longer of any consequence.<br> Not knowing what else to do, I stepped onto the path and began to follow it home. <br><br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Ch a pt e r I I &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> ~<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>M</i>y return was a bleak event. The gates were rusted open, the gardens overgrown and tangled. As I came to the chateau I saw crumbled walls and broken windows and exposed beams like<br> shattered ribs where the roof had fallen in. The elements, the animals and insects had all found their way inside. The furni- ture, fine tapestries and luxurious carpets were rotting away. Expensive baubles had been scattered and broken and the colors of valuable paintings washed away by rain. If I had not known, I would never have recognized my beautiful home. But I knew now. The moment I put my hairy paws through the gates, I knew it all again.<br> That night I crept into the entrance hall, through the drifts of decaying leaves and piles of rubble. My arrival disturbed a veritable horde of verminous beetles, black and glittering, that fled at my approach, scuttling away into cracks in the broken stonework. I lay down before the fireplace. I could not light a fire, but I had my accursed fur. Weary and sorrowful beyond belief, I followed the example of the dogs I had owned, many<br>&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>8</i> <br> &nbsp;<br> years before, and laid my great, shaggy head upon my paws and fell asleep.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> When I awoke&#x2014;seemingly but a moment after I had closed my eyes&#x2014;it had all changed.<br> It was the fire that woke me. The instant I felt its glow on my flank and heard the quick snap of wood, I was roused. At the sight of the flames dancing brightly in the grate, I sprang vio- lently back, hurtling into a chair. I knocked it over, scrambled up and backed away. The chair was upholstered in wine-colored velvet and familiar to me. It had been a favorite station by the fire once, long ago. Warily I looked about and saw my hall as I remembered it. But to my beast&#x2019;s nostrils, the air stank of magic, recently invoked.<br> As I stared around myself, a movement caught my eye. An earwig crawled over the velvet brocade arm of the fallen chair and disappeared. Then, before my eyes, the chair righted itself and moved back into place. I had been a beast for many years and had only just remembered myself. For longer than I had lived as a man I had let wild instinct govern me, and it governed me still. I fled. The great doors were shut fast, so I bolted up the grand staircase, only to be halted at the halfway landing. Here was an elaborate Venetian mirror; taller than a man, it dominated the landing where the staircase branched. The sight of myself in this mirror brought me up hard. I was frozen. I could not run. Not from myself.<br> I was no pretty creature. Not built like a wolf or a bear or a lion; yet, a little of each. I had the lion&#x2019;s mane&#x2014;a mass of dark, dark hair growing about my face and neck and over my shoul- ders. I was massive, my paws armed with long, sharp talons I <br><br>&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>9</i><br> &nbsp;<br>could never sheathe, and crowning my head were a pair of gnarled and twisted horns. But my eyes&#x2014;oh, my eyes! They were unchanged; as blue and human as the day the curse had been laid. No wonder people ran in terror from me. To recog- nize my eyes and know the horror and corruption I had become&#x2014;how they must have feared me.<br> Now my own eyes held me. I stared into them, they stared into me. Around them, instead of a nobleman with elegantly clipped hair and clothes of velvet and satin, was a beast with tangled, matted fur and slavering jaws, groveling on all four feet.<br> After the first shocked moment of realization, such despair and anger surged within my monstrous breast that, snarling, I hurled myself at the mirror.<br> I met the cold, implacable glass with such force it cracked in two. I fell back. What I saw only enraged me further. My hack- les rose. Each half now reflected back to me my image. Two sets of shocked, blue eyes now stared at me from within the broken frame. I gave a roar and threw myself forward again, one thought in my brain: <i>No mirrors. I will not abide any mirrors.</i><br> Again and again I attacked that great slab of mocking, sil- vered glass. Each time it cracked, a new set of glaring, human eyes would be there, staring out from the abomination of my face. I tore at it with my claws and blindly pounded my horns against its surface. Shards of glass began to fall around me, smashing apart on the marble floor. Finally, the entire thing shat- tered, cascading to the floor in a thousand fragments. I stood on my four feet, swaying with exhaustion, surveying the destruction I had wrought. It was enough. Nowhere could I see a sliver large enough to show me what I had become.<br> What little strength I had left now deserted me. I collapsed, exhausted from my frenzy and torn and bleeding from my work. <br><br>&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>10</i> <br> &nbsp;<br> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *<br> &nbsp;<br> When I awoke the next morning, I was sprawled upon the bed I had used when I was human. The room was hung with cob- webs and thick with dust, but the dirt and tangles had been combed from my fur, the insidious splinters of glass removed<br> and my gashes dressed and bound.<br> On a chest at the foot of the bed was a tray upon which sat a most unappetizing breakfast. Stale bread, withered fruit and a thin, greasy gruel. Still, I was hungry enough to eat anything. A tarnished spoon lay beside the food: a utensil I had no hope of being able to use. In bitter humiliation I ate by thrusting my blunt nose into the middle of the mea...</p></p><h2>The Excellent Wife: Teacher&#39;s Guide</h2><p>A companion study guide written and designed to provide reinforcement of the principles presented in the popular book.

Most European languages are descended from a single ancestor, a language not unlike Sanskrit known as Proto-Indo-European (or PIE for short), but the continent's ever-changing borders and cultures have given rise to a linguistic and cultural diversity that is too often forgotten in discussions of Europe as a political entity. <i>Lingo</i> takes us into today's remote mountain villages of Switzerland, where Romansh is still the lingua franca, to formerly Soviet Belarus, a country whose language was Russified by the Bolsheviks, to Sweden, where up until the 1960s polite speaking conventions required that one never use the word "you" in conversation, leading to tiptoeing questions of the form: "Would herr generaldirekt�r Rexed like a biscuit?"<br><br>Spanning six millenia and sixty languages in bite-size chapters, <i>Lingo</i> is a hilarious and highly edifying exploration of how Europe speaks.</p><p><b>Gaston Dorren</b> is a linguist, journalist, and polyglot.

A statesman as well as an artist and the writer of scientific essays, poetry, and criticism, the German author sealed his immortality with this ambitious drama and its embodiment of eighteenth-century humanism. Goethe based his protagonist on figures of history and legend, and of all the many Faustian legends, his remains the best known. <br>This sumptuous edition features&nbsp;John Anster's excellent translation, acclaimed for its truth to the meter of the original German verse. Nearly 30 illustrations by Harry Clarke, eight of them in full color, enhance the text. Created in the early 1920s, Clarke's images reflect the influences of Art Nouveau and Art Deco, forming a powerful contribution to the supernatural air of Goethe's masterpiece.</p><p>German artist, writer, and politician, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749&#x2013;1832) created a remarkably diverse body of work that includes poetry, novels, plays, literary criticism, and scientific treatises. Many of his poems were set to music by Beethoven, Schumann, Brahms, and other composers. <i>Faust</i> is his best-known work.A leading figure in the Irish Arts &amp; Crafts movement, Harry Clarke (1889&#x2013;1931) began his career as an award winning stained glass artist. His illustrations for the works of Hans Christian Andersen, Edgar Allan Poe, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, and others recall the styles of Aubrey Beardsley and Kay Nielsen.</p><h2>Chasing the Flame: One Man&#39;s Fight to Save the World</h2><p><b>From the author of <i>The Education of an Idealist</i> -&nbsp;<br><br>Soon to be the Netflix biopic, <i>Sergio</i>, with&nbsp;<i>Narcos</i>&nbsp;star Wagner Moura playing diplomat Sergio Vieira de Mello</b><br><br>In this perfect match of author and subject, Pulitzer Prize-winner Samantha Power tackles the life of Sergio Vieira de Mello, whose work for the U.N. before his 2003 death in Iraq was emblematic of moral struggle on the global stage. Power has drawn on a staggering breadth of research (including 400 interviews) to show us a heroic figure and the conflicts he waded into, from Cambodia's Khmer Rouge to the slaughter in Bosnia to the war-torn Middle East. The result is a peerless portrait of humanity and pragmatism, as well as a history of our convulsive age.<br><br>.</p><p><b>Samantha Power</b>&nbsp;is the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of&nbsp;<i>A Problem from Hell: America and the Age of Genocide</i>. Power&#x2019;s work has been awarded the National Book Critics Circle Award for general non-fiction, the J.

An ambitious effort...[that] succeeds brilliantly"<br>-James Mann, <i>The Washington Post</i><br><br> "Her book [has] the dramatic quality of a leaked memo. . . . Sergio Vieira de Mello, with his flaws and heroism, represents us at our best and at our most helpless." <br>-Paul Berman, <i>Slate</i><br><br> "[A] detailed and sympathetic biography . . . thoughtful." <br>-<i>The Economist</i><br><br> "Power presents a fiercely precise, extraordinary dramatic biography. . . . Strongly argued, lacerating, and utterly human, this invaluable history will be the catalyst for soul searching and debate." <br>-<i>Booklist</i><br><br> "Deeply and impressively reported."<br> -Tim Rutten, <i>Los Angeles Times</i><br><br> "<i>Chasing the Flame</i> is an impressively researched book. Power's notes include references to more than 400 interviews, and she cites everything from interoffice emails to Vieira de Mello's high school term papers. Casting a wide net provides Power with memorable details that capture Vieira de Mello's charisma and complexity: a bottle of Johnny Walker hidden in his desk, a plastic bag full of foreign coins for payphones . . . she nimbly excavates colorful artifacts from Vieira de Mello's life." <br>- <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i><br><br> "A masterful biography."<br>-Marie Claire<br><br> "In meticulous, unsentimental prose, Power portrays Vieira de Mello not as a martyr but as a man who knew too much, a tragic emblem of squandered opportunities in Iraq. . . . In eloquently asking who will keep [the flame] alive, Power proves herself a worthy candidate."<br> -<i>Vogue</i> <br><br> "<i>Chasing the Flame</i> is a brilliantly researched biography about an extraordinary man." <br>-<i>The Times</i> (UK)<br><br> "Power, who combines humanitarian passion and a girlish capacity for hero- worship with analytical rigor, a clear prose style and a gift for narrative, has written a remarkable book. It is not only a gripping story, which takes on the awful fascination of a Greek tragedy as it approaches the catastrophic ending. . . . It also forces the reader to think about some of the most uncomfortable issues in contemporary politics, without offering an easy or simple solution." <br>-<i>The Guardian</i> (UK)<br><br> "A compelling work, culminating in a brilliant and moving reconstruction of Vieira de Mello's doomed last mission in Iraq, and the frantic, disorganized rescue efforts to pull survivors from the bombed-out Canal Hotel as his life seeped away in the rubble." <br>-<i>The Times Literary Supplement</i> (UK)</p><h2>I Loved Jesus in the Night: Teresa of Calcutta&#x2015;A Secret Revealed</h2><p><p><i>I Loved Jesus in the Night</i>&nbsp;is one priest's compelling account of meeting with the Saint of Calcutta.

How does exercise help my heart, and what is the right amount and type of exercise? What are the most important tests for my heart, and when do I need them? How do symptoms and treatments differ among men, women, and children?<br><br>Backed by decades of clinical experience and up-to-the-minute research, yet written in the accessible, down-to-earth tone of your trusted family doctor, <i>Heart 411</i> cuts through the confusion to give you the knowledge and tools you need to live a long and heart-healthy life.</p><p><p><b> Featured Interview: Marc Gillinov and Steven Nissen</b></p> <p> <strong>Q. </strong>What are some of the risk factors of coronary heart disease that we are least likely to know about?</p> <p> <strong>A. </strong>Unfortunately most people don't know the simple, basic risk factors--LDL (the "bad" cholesterol), blood pressure, and body mass index (a measure of obesity). Together, these three risk factors plus smoking and diabetes, predict more than 80 percent of the risk for heart disease. We also have a growing list of emerging and sometimes surprising risk factors for heart disease. These include rheumatoid arthritis, sleep apnea, periodontal/gum disease, and even air pollution.</p> <p> <strong>Q. </strong>Do 1-2 glasses of wine a day really stave off heart disease?</p> <p> <strong>A. </strong>People who drink moderately are less likely to develop coronary artery disease and more likely to live longer than people who abstain from alcohol. This makes biological sense, as alcohol increases HDL cholesterol and reduces blood clotting. The evidence is solid, but we don't have conclusive proof that wine staves off heart disease. Nevertheless, a glass of wine (or a beer or a scotch) a day can be part of a heart healthy lifestyle.</p> <p> <strong>Q. </strong>How does stress affect the heart?</p> <p> <strong>A. </strong>Today we understand the link between emotional stress and heart attacks. In the patient with coronary artery disease, stress can trigger a heart attack by causing release of hormones and chemicals that increase blood pressure and heart rate and also increase the tendency for blood to clot. Anger is a common heart attack trigger, with up to 3 percent of heart attacks preceded by bouts of intense anger. Managing emotional stress can be life-saving for the patient with coronary artery disease.</p> <p> <strong>Q. </strong>Is red meat really that bad for the heart?</p> <p> <strong>A. </strong>Red meat contains large quantities of saturated fat, which is linked to increased LDL cholesterol and an increased risk of heart disease. An occasional steak or hamburger is fine, but a diet that includes daily consumption of red meat, especially when compared to a diet rich in fish, is associated with an increased risk of developing coronary heart disease. If you do eat meat, choose less fatty cuts and limit portion sizes.</p> <p><strong>Q. </strong>Why is this book so important? How is it different than other books on heart disease?</p> <p> <strong>A. </strong>This book is about proven strategies to achieve and maintain heart health. Today there is simply too much health information on the Web and on the bookshelves. Some of it is accurate, but much of it is completely wrong. Your heart-health is too important for you to get sucked in by ridiculous fads. You can't afford to make critical mistakes based upon incorrect and confusing information. In this book, we detail the evidence, dispel the myths, and distill the truth.

These behavior patterns take many forms: fear of rejection, codependence, narcissism, compartmentalizing, alcoholism and eating disorders, to mention a few. By "turning on the power of self-esteem" through self-assessment, changing old habits and using techniques borrowed from AA and other 12-step programs as well as traditional psychotherapy, we can overcome these self-defeating patterns that prevent us from realizing our potential.

His working life coincided with the explosive development of music technology that ran from the 1960s through the following three decades. Without such inventions as the Marshall amplifier, the Gibson SG, the wah-wah pedal, and the Synclavier &#x2013; much of it modified to his requirements and used in ways for which they had never been designed &#x2013; Zappa's &#x201c;air sculptures &#x201d; as his music has been described, would have had a significantly different shape and texture.<br><br>Lavishly illustrated &#x2013; including over 180 unique photographs of Frank Zappa's guitars and equipment taken by the author at his UMRK studio in LA and featuring a foreword by Dweezil Zappa &#x2013; Zappa Gear offers an unprecedented inside look at the machinery behind the legendary music.

However, after two and a half years on horseback with two of his trusty and tough steeds, this daring trekker lived to tell his best-selling tale. <br><br> Tschiffely&#x2019;s 10,000-mile journey was filled with adventure and triumph, but it also forced the traveler to deal with tremendous natural and man-made obstacles, as many countries in Central America were war-torn. He traversed rivers and mountains in hurricanes and hail storms, stopping to stay the night with farmers and villagers in huts who often shared their mysterious and superstitious tales. He ate dried goats&#x2019; meat in a desolate town of Santiago del Estero, watched illegal cockfights and vicious machete battles between plantation workers in Jujuy, and was healed by an Indian herb doctor in the mountains of Bolivia for his infection after excavating graves; these obstacles have captured the hearts of people from around the world. <br><br>In addition to the remarkable details of his travel expedition, Tschiffely&#x2019;s relationship with his horses, Mancha and Gato, is perhaps the most endearing element of the book, and his photos of the people and places he encountered make <i>Tschiffely&#x2019;s Ride</i> the perfect travel companion for adventure enthusiasts.</p><p>Aim� Tschiffely had been teaching in an English&#x2013;American school in Argentina for almost a decade when he conceived his astounding plan: to travel from Buenos Aires to New York&#x2014;10,000 miles&#x2014;on horseback. In April 1925, Tschiffely set out with two native Argentine horses, Mancha and Gato, and with rugged determination, the trio traversed the Pampas, scaled the Bolivian Andes, struggled through Peruvian sands, swam the crocodile&#x2013;infested rivers of Columbia, and fought their way through the jungles of Panama. They crossed Central America through countries devastated by years of war to finally reach Washington D.C., followed by a reception in New York. The three had been together, exclusively, for more than two years; during that time, Tschiffely developed a remarkable relationship with his horses&#x2014;an affinity that has seldom been equaled. This colorful account is a true classic of travel literature and perhaps one of the greatest animal stories ever written.<strong>Aim� Tschiffely</strong> (1895&#x2013;1954) was a Swiss-born teacher, writer, and travel enthusiast. After a brief stint in professional football and boxing in England during his early twenties, he moved to Argentina to teach and eventually serve as the temporary headmaster of the Buenos Aires English High School. His schedule allowed time for treks throughout the surrounding Pampas. He is the author of <em>A Tale of Two Horses</em>, <em>Coricancha</em>, and <em>This Way Southward</em>.</p><h2>The Big Stick</h2><p><b>"A must-read for anyone interested in military might--and how it can help us maintain the edge we need in this treacherous age." --Walter Russell Mead, <i>Wall Street Journal</i></b><br>In <i>The Big Stick</i>, Eliot A.

In the twenty-first, the story is expanding to enfold many universes. Michio Kaku&#39;s dazzling book tells that new story. Using the latest astronomical data, he explores the Big Bang, theories of everything, and our cosmic future. His wonderfully clear scientific account leads to some mind-boggling speculations about the human implications of this story. Are we condemned to watch a single universe slowly run down, becoming a dark, cold wasteland? Or can we dream of escaping into one of many parallel universes, each born of a new Big Bang, or even existing in another dimension? Kaku shows how the new cosmology points to these and other astonishing possibilities.</p><p>Is our universe dying? <br>Could there be other universes?<br>In "Parallel Worlds," world-renowned physicist and bestselling author Michio Kaku"--an" author who "has a knack for bringing the most ethereal ideas down to earth" "(Wall Street Journal)--takes readers on a fascinating tour of cosmology, M-theory, and its implications for the fate of the universe. <br>In his first book of physics since "Hyperspace, Michio Kaku begins by describing the extraordinary advances that have transformed cosmology over the last century, and particularly over the last decade, forcing scientists around the world to rethink our understanding of the birth of the universe, and its ultimate fate. In Dr. Kaku's eyes, we are living in a golden age of physics, as new discoveries from the WMAP and COBE satellites and the Hubble space telescope have given us unprecedented pictures of our universe in its infancy. <br>As astronomers wade through the avalanche of data from the WMAP satellite, a new cosmological picture is emerging. So far, the leading theory about the birth of the universe is the "inflationary universe theory," a major refinement on the big bang theory. In this theory, our universe may be but one in a multiverse, floating like a bubble in an infinite sea of bubble universes, with new universes being created all the time. A parallel universe may well hover a mere millimeter from our own. <br>The very idea of parallel universes and the string theory that can explain their existence was once viewed with suspicion by scientists, seen as the province of mystics, charlatans, and cranks. But today, physicists overwhelmingly support string-theory, and its latest iteration, M-theory, as it is this onetheory that, if proven correct, would reconcile the four forces of the universe simply and elegantly, and answer the question "What happened before the big bang?" <br>Already, Kaku explains, the world's foremost physicists and astronomers are searching for ways to test the theory of the multiverse using highly sophisticated wave detectors, gravity lenses, satellites, and telescopes. The implications of M-theory are fascinating and endless. If parallel worlds do exist, Kaku speculates, in time, perhaps a trillion years or more from now, as appears likely, when our universe grows cold and dark in what scientists describe as a big freeze, advanced civilizations may well find a way to escape our universe in a kind of "inter-dimensional lifeboat." <br>An unforgettable journey into black holes and time machines, alternate universes, and multidimensional space, "Parallel Worlds gives us a compelling portrait of the revolution sweeping the world of cosmology.Michio Kaku is the co-founder of String Field Theory and is the author of international best-selling books such as Hyperspace, Visions, and Beyond Einstein.

But with his discretion, his reliability, and his unique talent for death by &#x201c;natural causes,&#x201d; no one is willing to let him just retire. So when an old nemesis from the Japanese national police force comes to him with a new job&#x2014;eliminate Murakami, a killer even more fearsome than Rain himself&#x2014;he can&#x2019;t refuse. </p><p>Aided by an achingly desirable half Brazilian, half Japanese exotic dancer he knows he shouldn&#x2019;t trust, Rain pursues his quarry through underground no-holds-barred fight clubs, mobbed-up hostess bars, and finally into the heart of a shadow war between the CIA and the yakuza. It&#x2019;s a war Rain can&#x2019;t win, but also one he can&#x2019;t afford to lose&#x2014;a war where the distinctions between friend and foe and truth and deceit are as murky as the rain-slicked streets of Tokyo. </p><p><i>A Lonely Resurrection</i> was previously published as <i>Hard Rain</i> in the US and <i>Blood From Blood</i> in the UK, the second in the bestselling John Rain assassin series. </p></p><p><p>Barry Eisler's half-breed freelance assassin John Rain returns to Tokyo for a second outing in Hard Rain, the sequel to Eisler's stunning 2002 debut, Rain Fall. Once again Rain is working with, or at least parallel to, Tatsu, a wily veteran of Japan's FBI equivalent, who aims to cleanse the Japanese government of its systemic corruption. To further this goal, he's persuaded the ever-cautious Rain to take out Murakami, a brutal gangster and hitman who specializes in making his killings look like suicide, a specialty Rain thought was his alone. Liquidating the dangerous and elusive Murakami proves to be a difficult task, however, one that leads to personal loss for Rain, and sets the plot on course for a climax that hits with the power of a well-delivered roundhouse kick.</p><p>Eisler builds on Rain's self-enforced isolation and loneliness as he expertly shows the reader Tokyo as channeled by Chandler, transforming the burgeoning metropolis into a noir catacomb of dimly lit hostess bars, scheming bureaucrats, shadowy intelligence agents, and outlaw martial arts <i>dojos</i> where thugged-up yakuza train for illicit death matches.</p><p>While the plot becomes complicated toward the novel's conclusion, Rain is a refreshing and complex character whom readers will want to see return for another installment. If you've a yen for a thriller that mixes suspense, intrigue, and action with a Japanese flavor and a hardboiled American attitude, Eisler's <i>Hard Rain</i> is an excellent choice. &#x2014;<i>Benjamin Reese</i></p><p><b>Introduction to the New Edition</b></p><p>Having just finished rereading and slightly revising <i>A Lonely Resurrection</i> exactly ten years after first writing it, I'm struck by two things. First, how well the book has held up. Part of the credit for this goes to Tokyo, where the story is largely set -- a city whose face is constantly changing but whose essence never does. I lived there again in 2008 and 2009, fifteen years after my first sojourn in Rain's city, and I loved that despite the new surface contours, despite the loss of a few <i>A Lonely Resurrection</i> locales and changes to some others, the feeling of the place was exactly as I remembered. I expect it always will be.</p><p>The second thing that struck me was the prescience of the plot in light of the nuclear catastrophe that followed the earthquake and tsunami of March 11, 2011. I tend to get my plot ideas from real-world occurrences, and here are a few that appear in the book:</p><p><i>Universal Studios Japan, it turned out, had been serving food that was nine months past its due date and falsifying labels to hide it, while operating a drinking fountain pumping out untreated industrial water.

Snow Brand Food liked to save a few yen by recycling old milk and failing to clean factory pipes. Couldn't cover that one up -- fifteen-thousand people were poisoned. Mitsubishi Motors and Bridgestone got nailed hard, concealing defects in cars and tires to avoid safety recalls. The worst, shocking even by Japanese standards, was the news that TEPCO, Tokyo Electric Power, had been caught submitting falsified nuclear safety reports going back twenty years. The reports failed to list serious problems at eight different reactors, including cracks in concrete containment shrouds...</i></p><p>I wrote that in 2002. I had access only to open-source materials. The potential for calamity was visible to anyone who wanted to see it. As, indeed, my character Tatsu did:</p><p><i>He pulled himself up and sat on the edge of the tub to take a break from the heat. "You know, Rain-san," he said, "societies are like organisms, and no organism is invulnerable to disease. What matters is whether an organism can mount an effective defense when it finds itself under attack. In Japan, the virus of corruption has attacked the immune system itself, like a societal form of AIDS. Consequently, the body has lost its ability to defend itself. This is what I mean when I say that all countries have problems, but only Japan has problems it has lost the ability to solve. The TEPCO managers resign, but the men charged with regulating their activities for all those years remain? Only in Japan..."</i></p><p><i>He wiped his brow. "So. Consider this state of affairs from Yamaoto's perspective. He understands that, with the immune system suppressed, there must eventually be a catastrophic failure of the host. There have been so many near misses -- financial, ecological, nuclear -- it is only a matter of time before a true cataclysm occurs. Perhaps a nuclear accident that irradiates an entire city. Or a countrywide run on banks and loss of deposits. Whatever it is, it will finally be of sufficient magnitude to shake Japan's voters from their apathy..."</i></p><p>It remains to be seen whether the corruption and collusion that led to Japan's nuclear nightmare will be enough to shake voters from their apathy. I might have been mistaken about that. And I obviously was mistaken in suggesting that Japanese apathy in the face of extraordinary corruption is somehow unique. The last decade in America has seen a war sold to the public on false pretenses, high officials confessing to ordering torture in violation of treaty and domestic law, and an economic meltdown even former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan acknowledges involved massive fraud -- and no one has been prosecuted, no one has gone to prison, and Americans continue to dutifully cast their votes for the Democratic/Republican duopoly responsible for these disasters.</p><p>A last thought: it's not just the politics in these books that subsequent events keep validating; it's also the technology. In <i>A Lonely Resurrection,</i> Tatsu tracks Rain to Osaka using a nationwide system of video cameras tied to advanced facial recognition software. Here's what's going on in Japan today, ten years later:</p><p>yomiuri.co.jp/dy/national/T121128004400.htm</p><p>So despite the presence of the odd anachronistic pager or two, I think on balance A Lonely Resurrection has proven itself not only stalwart, but indeed not-so-surprisingly ahead of its time. See for yourself -- and I hope you'll enjoy it.</p></p><h2>Silica Water the Secret of Healthy Longevity in the Aluminum Age</h2><p>Research on the world&#39;s five blue zones, where people live longer than normal, reveals high levels of dissolved silica in their drinking water. This book describes this research and explains why dissolved silica is a causal factor of longevity. Learn how silica water prevents, and heals the following conditions and terminal diseases: Alzheimer&#39;s, Atherosclerosis, Heart Disease, Autism, Multiple Sclerosis, Osteoporosis, Parkinson&#39;s, and Seizures. Dr. Crouse majored in biochemistry at Harvard College and has a Ph.D. in chemistry from Harvard University.</p><p>My interest in silica water was inspired by a desire to help my mother slow the progression of her Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease. My mother was 86 when she lost her short term memory and was diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The facts that she had MCI and could no longer perform daily tasks, such as meal preparation, sewing and balancing the checkbook, were indications she had Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease. In order to save my mother from the terrible death of end-stage Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease (AD), I devoted myself to studying scientific literature looking for causal factors of AD. My belief was that only by finding a causal factor could I help my mother stop the progression of AD. I was fortunate as a freshman at Harvard to have Dr. Lewis L. Engle Professor of Biological Chemistry at Harvard Medical School as my tutor. During our first meeting Dr. Engle suggested I read a book written almost 40 years earlier by Lawrence J. Henderson Assistant Professor of Biological Chemistry at Harvard University entitled &#x201c;The Fitness of The Environment&#x201d;. This book describes how the earth&#x2019;s chemical environment made life on earth sustainable. The information in Henderson&#x2019;s book shaped my career path. Even before graduating from Harvard with a Ph.D. I cofounded a company to detect and quantify toxic chemicals in food. The company&#x2019;s commercial chemical analysis laboratory performed analytical procedures for a wide variety of toxic environmental chemicals. Most of these toxic chemicals are man-made and eroding the fitness of our environment for sustaining life on earth. Because of my recent research into mother&#x2019;s Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease, I have now added aluminum to the list of toxic chemicals that are increasing in our diet and accumulating in our brains due to man&#x2019;s influence. Aluminum is a neurotoxin and chronic accumulation of aluminum has been linked to a variety of diseases, including Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease. Aluminum has become more bioavailable since the dawn of the Aluminum Age in the 1880&#x2019;s when a process to purify aluminum from bauxite was developed. Like the Stone, Bronze, and Iron Ages that preceded it, the Aluminum Age has brought great changes, both good and bad, to human civilization.

The result is that a beautiful, powerful concept that should be uniting the church is now contributing to its fragmentation. This is why <i>Kingdom Conspiracy</i> is one of the most important and timeliest works to be written in recent years. McKnight brings much-needed clarity to what 'kingdom of God' means--and doesn't mean--and how it relates to the church and its mission.

The casual manner in which we toss around phrases like 'kingdom theology' and 'missional churches' can have an adverse effect on our efforts to form a robust ecclesiology. Evoking 'kingdom' language has become the new vogue among missional communities--almost as in vogue as the word 'missional' itself. With prescient analysis and pastoral insight, Scot McKnight succeeds in providing a scriptural and theological text for those who have heard the word so often but failed to think through its meaning.

At times it had me yelling 'Amen!' and at other times it just had me yelling. But if you keep wrestling, this book will inspire you to a greater vision of the church--greater than self-focused seclusion, greater than the coercion of a new clandestine Christendom, greater than personal social action. Scot is a kingdom pacifist picking fights with pastors and activists alike until we bleed with passion for what the local church is graced to be: where God's will is done, where the kingdom has come, where the incarnation is continued, where God's future is happening, now!"<br>--<b>Jarrod McKenna</b>, Australian Peace Award-winning activist, pastor, and cofounder of First Home Project<br><br>"In <i>Kingdom Conspiracy</i>, McKnight critiques those of us who have reduced the kingdom to social action or personal salvation.

Throughout the vivid detail provided in Genesis, Dr. Fruchtenbaum's exegesis allows God's Word to make its own case for a literal interpretation of the Bible. Dr. Fruchtenbaum's grammatical, historical-geographical approach to Scriptures from a Jewish perspective provides the reader an exciting new way to grasp and unlock the richness of this book of the beginnings of all nations, and in particular, the beginning of the nation of Israel.<br><br>For instance, Dr. Fruchtenbaum brings to life the many genealogies in Genesis as they relate to God's promises of a Messiah. Genesis makes clear the Messiah would one day come out of Israel to redeem the nation of Israel and to bless all the families of the earth.<br><br>Important to understanding one's relationship to God, Genesis presents four of God's eight covenants. Three are covenants God made with humanity in general, and these are associated with the familiar stories of Creation, the Fall, and the Flood. The fourth one, an unconditional covenant with Abraham, is the beginning of the story of the nation of Israel, based on God's promises of descendants and Land to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. The account of the nation of Israel that Moses begins in Genesis, he then continues in the four books of the Bible that follow.</p><p>Arnold G. Fruchtenbaum, Th.M., Ph.D, is one of the foremost authorities on the nation of Israel, and is a messianic Jewish believer. This has made him a popular speaker and teacher at Bible conferences, congregations, and churches throughout the world. He received his B.A. from Cedarville University, his Th.M from Dallas Theological Seminary, and his Ph.D. from New York University. His graduate work also includes studies at the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Based in San Antonio, TX he is the founder of Ariel Ministries, which is dedicated to evangelism of Jewish people and discipleship of Jewish and Gentile believers from a messianic Jewish frame of reference.</p><h2>Double Take!

The twilight of the Cold War. The KGB is at its most ruthless, and has now indisputably gained the upper hand over the CIA in the intelligence war. But no one knows how. Ten CIA agents and double-agents have gone missing in the last three years. They have either been executed or they are unaccounted for.<br> <br>At Langley, several theories circulate as to how the KGB seems suddenly to have become telepathic, predicting the CIA's every move. Some blame the defection of Edward Lee Howard three years before, and suspect that there are more high-placed moles to be unearthed. Others speculate that the KGB's surveillance successes have been heightened by the invention of an invisible electromagnetic powder that allows them to keep tabs on anyone who touches it: spy dust.<br> <br>CIA officers Tony Mendez and Jonna Goeser come together to head up a team of technical wizards and operational specialists, determined to solve the mystery that threatens to overshadow the Cold War's final act. Working against known and unknown hostile forces, as well as some unfriendly elements within the CIA, they devise controversial new operational methods and techniques to foil the KGB, and show the extraordinary lengths that US intelligence is willing to go to protect a source, then rescue him when his world starts to collapse. At the same time, Tony and Jonna find themselves falling deeply in love.<br> <br>During a fascinating odyssey that began in Indochina fifteen years before and ends in a breathtakingly daring operation in the heart of the Kremlin's Palace of Congresses, <i>Spy Dust</i> catapults the reader from the Hindu Kush to Hollywood, from Havana to Moscow, but cannot truly conclude until its protagonists are safely wedded in rural Maryland.</p><p><b>Antonio Mendez</b> is the former chief of disguise for the CIA.

He spun the steering wheel back and forth with one beefy hand, and with the other deftly shifted gears like a race car driver as we sped down the narrow, winding streets of this moldering tropical city.<br><br>I knew that even though we couldn't see them in the dark, every structure we passed was mildewed and slowly crumbling back into the black loam and teeming vegetation from where it had come long before the British carved out their colonial outpost here more than a century ago.<br><br>Maxwell, a large man with sloping shoulders, was slouched against the right-hand door, on the driver's side of the old car. He had borrowed this wreck from one of the office secretaries for his nighttime forays. He was wearing a pair of tortoiseshell glasses, a Band-Aid mustache, and a floppy hat, one of the many quick-change disguises that I had devised for him and his intelligence sources to use for their meetings after dark. Such subterfuge was the only way CIA officers could meet their assets -- locals recruited by U.S. intelligence -- in this hostile environment.<br><br>Maxwell would sometimes have eight or nine operational meetings a night, which pushed the bounds of good security practices. Most meetings took place in the old car while he drove his asset around on the back streets, debriefing them while continuing to run surveillance-detection runs -- SDRs, as they are known in the spy trade -- to ensure they weren't being followed.<br><br>Tonight was a special trip. We would be breaking new ground on this case, and thanks to my disguises, Maxwell would be bringing his best agent home for a sit-down meeting in the civilized surroundings of his house, an almost unheard of luxury.<br><br>We were approaching a double corner as we passed the swimming club where Maxwell would execute a rolling car pickup. He slowed down, pressed on the brake pedal long enough for the forward motion of the car to be interrupted for half a heartbeat. He timed this stop to occur just as he passed behind the hedge on our left, next to the corner of the club building.<br><br>A dark figure moved out from behind the hedge at the same instant and entered the left front passenger door as I opened and closed it in one motion. The dome light had not come on.<br><br>The figure crouched safely on the floorboard of the car as Maxwell released his pressure on the brake pedal and our momentum carried us forward again. He pressed smoothly on the accelerator, and we continued on a circuitous route to the residential district out by the lake to our first destination.<br><br>The top-secret GAMBIT disguise was positioned on my lap. I had created it for the man at an earlier meeting, and I hoped to conduct a final fitting tonight. I planned to do this in the dark car as we moved along, in case we passed someone who knew him.<br><br>We started down a deserted stretch, and the man code-named SAPPHIRE had crawled up off the floor and was now sitting up directly in front of me. He knew what to expect as I reached over to show him how to put on the disguise. By the time Maxwell arrived at his cover stop, I had made final adjustments to SAPPHIRE's new persona and was handing him a small leather-bound credential, which he reviewed, then slipped into his pocket.<br><br>The houseboy and gate man at the cover stop didn't give us a second look as we waited in the car chatting while Maxwell made his phantom delivery to a friend, the cover reason for this trip.<br><br>Shortly, we were headed back to Maxwell's house, where I had been staying since my arrival from Washington, D.C. We had rounded a corner and were proceeding down a side street behind an enormous golden stupa, a Buddhist shrine, that marked the center of town.<br><br>Suddenly we were caught in the high beams of a vehicle blocking the center of the road. There were two uniformed and armed soldiers standing in front of the headlights of a camouflaged scout car. They signaled us to halt.<br><br>Maxwell stood on the brakes, and the ancient car lurched to a stop.<br><br>One of the military men approached the car on the passenger side and rapped on the glass with his swagger stick. SAPPHIRE rolled down the window, and the officer leaned his head so far into the car I was sure they would touch noses.<br><br>But he was not looking at SAPPHIRE at all. Instead, his gaze was focused on Maxwell.<br><br>"Evening, sir. May I see your papers?"<br><br>Maxwell presented his credential, handing it over in front of SAPPHIRE.<br><br>The officer shined his light on it, and then returned it. "Very good, sir. And what about these two gentlemen?"<br><br>Both SAPPHIRE and I were ready with our documents as well. His were in the credential case that I had given him minutes earlier.<br><br>After a quick look, the officer handed both of them back to SAPPHIRE and snapped to attention. "Thank you, Excellency," he said.<br><br>SAPPHIRE saluted back, and we were soon on our way.<br><br>A little later, we were relaxing over drinks at Maxwell's place, reliving the events of the evening. Maxwell suddenly turned to me. "By the way," he said, "that officer was awfully impressed with SAPPHIRE. What was that all about?"<br><br>"I knew the disguise would make him look older and distinguished," I said, "so I made him an attach� from an Eastern European country -- with the rank of general."<br><br>SAPPHIRE smiled, enjoying the promotion that he had carried off perfectly.<br><br>The young Russian KGB officer already had a distinct military bearing.<br><br>Copyright � 2002 by Antonio J.

In place of the domestic frump of popular imagination, Patricia Brady resurrects the wealthy, attractive, and vivacious young widow who captivated the youthful George Washington. Here are the able landowner, the indomitable patriot (who faithfully joined her husband each winter at Valley Forge), and the shrewd diplomat and emotional mainstay. And even as it brings Martha Washington into sharper and more accurate focus, this sterling life sheds light on her marriage, her society, and the precedents she established for future First Ladies.</p><p>"This is a beautiful, graceful, and elegantly-told love story about a passionate, strong-willed woman--our virtually unknown first First Lady--and her equally strong-willed and passionate husband, the first President of the United States. What is truly remarkable about this book is that the author has succeeded in humanizing George Washington, no easy task, let me assure you. Most books depict him as a stiff, unapproachable figure, but here he is a loving, caring and devoted husband of a gracious, kind and remarkable lady. It is amazing what the author has achieved, considering that Martha Washington destroyed most of the correspondence between herself and her husband over forty-one years. But two real, believable people emerge from this book, a tribute to the skill, scholarship and devotion poured into it by the author."<br> --Robert V.

It was the only trace of light in the house&#x2014;the rest lay shrouded by the night sky. <br>From where he was parked on the street, Dallin Forrest studied the property. It was an expansive, beige stucco house with a brown tile roof. A stream of river rocks snaked across the gravel, dividing a lawn of sparse trees and desert plants. <br>Dallin glanced at the clock on his car radio. The numbers glowed 10:05 P.M. In the passenger seat, his girlfriend, Michelle Lowery, stared at her lap and toyed with her cell phone. Her long, dark hair hung loose around her face, masking a fearful expression. <br>At the end of the street a set of headlights came into view. A car pulled alongside Dallin&#x2019;s and parked on the opposite side of the road. A petite brunette emerged from the vehicle&#x2014;Michelle&#x2019;s friend Mimi Hall. Dried tear tracks stained her cheeks, and her normally olive complexion had gone starkly white. <br>Dallin and Michelle stepped out of their car into the warm summer night. Mimi met them at the driveway, smiling weakly. <br>Without uttering a word, Dallin walked to the porch and rang the doorbell. Inside he heard the muted sounds of a dog barking. He hunched his lanky frame and peered through the decorative glass cutouts in the front door. In the dark, he saw the silhouette of the dog yapping in the foyer, pawing excitedly at the door. <br>A moment passed, but no one answered. <br>Michelle broke the silence. &#x201c;The light&#x2019;s on. Someone must be in the house.&#x201d; <br>Clutching her cell phone, she made a call. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re here,&#x201d; she said to the voice on the other end. &#x201c;No one is answering.&#x201d; <br>Dallin rang the doorbell again, five times in quick succession. <i>Ding. Ding. Ding. Ding. Ding.</i> <br>Approaching the garage, Michelle repeated four numbers&#x2014;0187&#x2014;into her phone as she typed the digits into the keyless entry pad. With a rumble, the door began to rise. <br>Parked inside the garage was a 2004 black Toyota Prius. There was no license plate, but a temporary registration card was affixed to the back window. Dallin immediately recognized the vehicle as belonging to the homeowner&#x2014;Travis Alexander. <br>Dallin had only met Travis a few times and knew little about the thirty-year-old motivational speaker and entrepreneur. His girlfriend was close friends with Travis, whom she had met through the local Mormon church. <br>Just a half hour earlier, Michelle had been at the house that twenty-year-old Dallin shared with his parents. They had gone to a nearby Walmart to run errands and had barely pulled back into his driveway when her cell phone rang. It was Mimi. <br>&#x201c;Hey, have you heard from Travis recently?&#x201d; she asked, her voice hollow. <br>&#x201c;No, I guess I haven&#x2019;t heard from him for at least a week,&#x201d; Michelle said. &#x201c;Why?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;We are going to Canc�n tomorrow and I haven&#x2019;t heard from him.&#x201d; Mimi swallowed involuntarily. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re supposed to leave in the morning.&#x201d; <br>Michelle knew about the trip. Travis and Mimi had been dating and a few weeks prior, he&#x2019;d invited her to join him on a business trip to Canc�n. As the date grew closer, however, Mimi had had second thoughts. She&#x2019;d called him and confessed she no longer wanted to pursue a romantic relationship. <br>&#x201c;I would totally understand if you wanted to take someone else to Mexico,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d added. <br>But it was too late to change the vacation plans. Because the tickets had already been purchased and arrangements had been made, they had agreed to go as friends. Their flight was scheduled for 9:25 the following morning, yet Mimi hadn&#x2019;t heard from Travis for more than a week. <br>&#x201c;I just went by his place, but no one answered the door,&#x201d; Mimi told Michelle. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve tried calling him and his voice mail is full. I&#x2019;ve called his house and cell phone. I&#x2019;m really worried. Have you heard anything at all?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Michelle said. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have any idea. Let me call Taylor and I&#x2019;ll call you back in a bit.&#x201d; <br>Taylor Searle was Travis&#x2019;s close friend and business partner. If anyone had heard from Travis, it would be Taylor, Michelle reasoned. <br>&#x201c;Other people have been asking me if I&#x2019;ve heard from Travis too,&#x201d; Taylor told Michelle on the phone. &#x201c;I thought he was out of town.&#x201d; <br>Michelle explained that she had just spoken to Mimi and that their flight was departing in the morning. <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m concerned,&#x201d; Michelle said. &#x201c;Do you think we should go over there?&#x201d; <br>Michelle covered the receiver with her palm and whispered to Dallin. &#x201c;Do you mind if we drive over there and see what&#x2019;s going on?&#x201d; <br>Moments later, they were headed toward Travis&#x2019;s house on the outskirts of Mesa&#x2019;s suburbs. Michelle phoned Mimi, and she agreed to meet them outside the residence. On the drive, Michelle told her boyfriend how Travis had seemed upset over his recent breakup. <br>&#x201c;But he seemed like he was getting better,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;He was getting over it.&#x201d; Travis was organized and responsible. There&#x2019;s no way he wouldn&#x2019;t respond to numerous e-mails, text messages, and phone calls. &#x201c;This isn&#x2019;t like Travis.&#x201d; She shook her head. <br>Turning onto East Queensborough Avenue, Dallin eased down on the brake, canvassing the block in the dim light of the street lamps. He parked along the curb painted with the house number, 11428. <br>Travis&#x2019;s two-story, five-bedroom house blended into the neighborhood. Ubiquitous stucco homes lined the blocks for miles in all directions. During the recent housing boom, new homes had cropped up rapidly across the desert, expanding the population to nearly 500,000. Despite being the third-largest city in Arizona, behind Phoenix and Tucson, Mesa was still a quiet community. Quaint boutiques, family-owned restaurants, and elaborate Mormon churches peppered the city. <br>Mesa was a hub for the Latter-day Saints residing in the Phoenix metro area. Travis himself had moved to the city in part to build a life in a strong Mormon community. <br>Through the church, Travis had cultivated a large network of loyal friends. Now, three of those friends were at his house trying to determine his whereabouts. <br>With growing apprehension, Dallin, Michelle, and Mimi entered the garage. Taylor Searle had given Michelle the code to the garage door. <br>&#x201c;All right&nbsp;&#x2026; well, his car&#x2019;s here,&#x201d; Michelle informed Taylor over the phone. &#x201c;Could someone have taken him to the airport? Maybe something happened, and he had to go out of town all of a sudden?&#x201d; <br>Dallin approached a door leading into the house, tried the handle, and found it unlocked. Groping the inside wall, he flicked on the light. The door opened into a narrow space with a washer and dryer. He stepped into the laundry room, which led to the main area of the house. To the left were the formal living and family rooms. On the right, a wide hallway opened up into the kitchen, TV room, and the stairway. <br>The walls were painted taupe, the floors a mottled brown tile. Dallin didn&#x2019;t know the layout but quickly became familiar. <br>As he stepped into the house, Dallin noticed a foul odor hanging in the air. <br>&#x201c;What is that smell?&#x201d; he muttered to himself. <br>Once inside, a black pug scurried toward them, wagging its tail. Michelle bent down and ran her fingers through its pelt. In the kitchen she noticed the dog&#x2019;s bowl, full of food. <br>&#x201c;Well, someone&#x2019;s taking care of his dog,&#x201d; she said. <br>In the living room, on top of the couch, two tall bar stools rested on their sides. Dallin noticed a tile-cleaner machine sitting upright in the middle of the floor, as if someone was preparing to clean. <br>Dallin, followed closely by Michelle and Mimi, checked each downstairs room, flicking on lights. Left of the TV room was a short hallway leading to a bathroom with a shower and tub. Across from the bathroom, on the opposite side of the hallway, was a den. <br>Mimi stepped in the bathroom and pulled back the shower curtain. It was empty. Turning back toward the hallway, she noticed the door to the home office was closed. <br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s check his office,&#x201d; Mimi said. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s where he spends most of his time.&#x201d; <br>A large mahogany desk took up most of the width of Travis&#x2019;s office. Atop the desk sat a silver Dell laptop, leather wallet, set of keys, and cell phone. Dallin picked up the phone and saw it was turned off. Inside the wallet, he discovered cash, credit cards, and the picture ID of an attractive man with cropped brown hair and vivid green eyes&#x2014;Travis Alexander. <br>Dallin shuddered. <br> <i>Where would he go, leaving his car, cell phone, and wallet?</i> Dallin wondered. <i>Where is he?</i> <br>Dallin left the den and headed back toward the stairwell; Michelle and Mimi trailed behind. Digging his nails into the wooden banister, he began to climb the steps, leading the way. <br>At the top of the stairs to his left were tall, white double doors, firmly shut. To his right was a spacious open loft, furnished with a leather sofa and three oversize beanbag chairs. A movie projector sat in the corner of the room next to a small table displaying a chess set. <br>As Dallin stepped onto the second-floor landing, he heard the faint sounds of music coming from the direction of the loft. The sounds became louder as he approached the hallway, blocked off by a dog gate. Dallin stepped over the gate, while the girls stayed behind in the hallway. Dallin pounded on the bedroom door where the sounds were coming from. <br>&#x201c;Hold on,&#x201d; someone inside the room hollered. &#x201c;Just a sec.&#x201d; <br>Half a minute passed and a tall young man with tousled dark-blond hair appeared at the entrance. Dallin didn&#x2019;t recognize him but would later learn it was Zachary Billings, one of Travis&#x2019;s roommates. <br>Immediately, Dallin spoke. <br>&#x201c;Have you seen Travis?&#x201d; he asked urgently. <br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s in Mexico,&#x201d; Zachary said. <br>Mimi piped up behind them in the hallway. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s not in Canc�n. I was going with him. We&#x2019;re supposed to leave in the morning.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Have you checked his room?&#x201d; Zachary asked. <br>&#x201c;No. I heard the music so&#x2026;&#x201d; Dallin let the thought trail off. <br>Zachary stepped over the gate and headed across the loft to the double doors on the other side of the staircase. <br>&#x201c;Travis?&#x201d; Zachary shouted as he pounded on the door. No response. He shook the handle, but it was locked. <br>&#x201c;Wait here a second,&#x201d; Zachary said. He left the three friends standing by the double doors. <br>As they waited, Michelle updated Taylor over the phone. <br>&#x201c;His roommate is here,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s getting a key.&#x201d; <br>A moment later Zachary reappeared with a key he&#x2019;d retrieved from a rack downstairs. He inserted it into the door, which unlocked with a rickety click. <br>As the doors swung open, Dallin grimaced. Inside the bedroom, the putrid stench permeating the air was more pungent. <br>From the doorway Dallin could see Travis&#x2019;s king-size bed&#x2014;the sheets had been removed and a duvet was piled in a ball in the middle of the bed. Next to the bed were two pillows, minus pillow cases, tossed on the floor. <br>Zachary slipped inside the room. Dallin followed. <br>A long, tiled hallway led into the master bathroom. A light gleamed from the direction of the bathroom&#x2014;the same light Dallin had noticed from the street. Paralleling the hallway was a walk-in closet, which had a second entrance to the bathroom on the opposite end. <br>As Dallin moved deeper into the room, a rust-brown mass on the floor caught his eye. A chunky, dark-red pool had congealed on the carpet. <br>&#x201c;Oh my God,&#x201d; Zachary muttered. <br>Dallin&#x2019;s heart began to race; his breath hastened. The two men exchanged a terrified look. <br> <i>What is that? Is that blood?</i> Dallin thought. <i> This is bad. Nobody does that to the carpet and leaves.</i> <br>Dallin stepped outside the double doors. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t come in,&#x201d; he told the girls. &#x201c;Stay out here.&#x201d; <br>By the time he turned back, Zachary had disappeared into the closet and toward the other entrance to the bathroom. <br>Dallin paused, unsure whether he wanted to continue. <i>If there is blood here, what more is there?</i> <br>He followed the crimson stains on the carpet toward the edge of the long bathroom hallway, where the muddy red puddles trailed over the tile like a path of footprints. <br>&#x201c;Oh my God,&#x201d; Zachary gasped. He rushed out of the room, past Dallin. <br>Dallin turned the corner and entered the bathroom. It took a moment to grasp the nightmarish sight. <br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; he whispered. <br>The glass shower door was open, exposing a corpse in a crumpled heap on the shower floor. Bloody punctures branded Travis&#x2019;s body, a deep gash severed his throat. He was naked, his skin a ghastly mosaic of blue and purple. Travis&#x2019;s once handsome face was unrecognizable. <br>&#x201c;I saw him curled up in the shower on the ground and I turned, I turned right back around,&#x201d; Dallin later recalled. <br>Backpedaling out of the master bedroom, he closed the doors, instinctively barricading himself from the horror. <br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s not alive,&#x201d; he said, his voice trembling. &#x201c;Call 911.&#x201d; <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>Red and blue rotating lights reflected off the dazed faces of the witnesses standing by the curb. The house on East Queensborough Avenue was surrounded by ambulances and police cruisers. Yellow police tape cordoned off the perimeter of the property. A uniformed officer stood guard by the front door. <br>At 11 P.M. Mesa Homicide Detective Esteban Flores arrived on the scene. By then, Travis&#x2019;s friends and roommates were already being questioned by officers. <br>Flores, a seasoned investigator with more than fourteen years on the force, was assigned as lead detective on the case. In his forties, with a husky build, thick black hair, and a dark complexion, Flores came across as stoic, with a staunch demeanor. <br>He approached one of the first responding officers on the scene and was briefed on the situation: the homeowner had been found in the master bathroom, deceased. He had been there at least a day or two and had wounds on his neck and chest. <br>&#x201c;Who found him?&#x201d; Flores asked. <br>Consulting his notes, the officer identified two of the people standing by the curb&#x2014;Dallin Forrest and Zachary Billings. <br>&#x201c;No one had heard from the guy for about a week,&#x201d; the officer told Flores. He reiterated what the witnesses had told him about Travis&#x2019;s planned trip to Mexico and how they had gained entry into the house. <br>Later, Flores would take official witness statements, as well as request DNA and fingerprint samples. First, however, he needed a closer and more careful look at the victim. <br>From what the witnesses had reported, the deceased had suffered a laceration wound to the neck. Flores had heard of cases where individuals had committed suicide in such a manner, although it was uncommon. Before launching an investigation he needed to assess the situation and determine if a crime had been committed. <br>Donning protective footwear and gloves, Flores entered the house through the front door, along with two fellow detectives and a commander. As Flores stepped inside, he winced. The odor was repulsive&#x2014;rank and sweet, the smell of decay. <br>The detectives inspected the downstairs, making note of the stand-up floor cleaner in the living room, and the chairs on the couch. Discovering nothing else out of the ordinary, the detectives approached the stairwell. <br>Slowly, they climbed the steps and entered the loft. As Flores glanced around, he jotted down notes about the layout of the upstairs. Near an oversize beanbag chair he noticed an open black camera bag. The camera was missing, he wrote in his notepad. <br>Flores focused his attention back toward the master bedroom. Flanking the king-size bed in the center of the room sat two nightstands. In the corner of the bedroom, adj...</p><h2>Where in the Wild?: Camouflaged Creatures Concealed... and Revealed</h2><p>Ten creatures await, camouflaged in artful, full-page photographs, while playful poems offer clues about each animal's identity and whereabouts.

And when Nina became pregnant, she took the same hard look at the nutritional advice for pregnancy and newborns, finding a tangle of often contradictory guidelines that seemed at odds with her own common sense. </p><p>In <i>Real Food for Mother and Baby</i>, Nina explains why some commonly held ideas about pregnancy and infant nutrition are wrongheaded--and why real food is good for growing minds and bodies. While her general concept isn't surprising, some of the details might be. For expecting mothers and babies up to two years old, the body's overwhelming requirements are fat and protein, not vegetables and low-fat dairy--which is why, for example, cereals aren't right for babies, but meat and egg yolks are excellent. </p><p>Nina shares tips and advice like a trusted friend, and in this updated edition, her afterword presents the latest findings and some newly won wisdom from watching her three children grow on real food.</p></p><p><p><b>Nina Planck</b> is a farmers' daughter, food writer, and farmers' market entrepreneur.

But until now, Catholics interested in their faith have been hard-pressed to find an accessible, affirmative, and exciting history of the Church.<br><i>Triumph</i> is that history. Inside, you'll discover the spectacular story of the Church from Biblical times and the early days of St. Peter&#x2014;the first pope&#x2014;to the twilight years of John Paul II. It is a sweeping drama of Roman legions, great crusades, epic battles, toppled empires, heroic saints, and enduring faith. And, there are stormy controversies: Dark Age skullduggery, the Inquistition, the Renaissance popes, the Reformation, the Church's refusal to accept sexual liberation and contemporary allegations like those made in <i>Hitler's Pope</i> and <i>Papal Sin.</i><br>A brawling, colorful history full of inspiring pageantry and spirited polemic, <i>Triumph</i> will exhilarate, amuse, and infuriate as it extols the glories of Catholic history and the gripping stories of its greatest men and women.</p><p>Catholics who tire of histories critical of their church will find much to love in <i>Triumph</i>, by the journalist and novelist H.W. Crocker III. With the enthusiasm of a convert, Crocker (formerly an Anglican) tells a story spanning 2,000 years, concentrating on the most heroic and adventurous chapters of church history. Crocker writes clear, crisp sentences ("Origen severed his genitals," begins one chapter; "A little looting goes a long way," opens another), and his version of Catholic history is one amazing scene after another. <i>Triumph</i> reads more like a historical novel than most other church histories, and that quality makes the book one of the most accessible historical surveys for younger readers. Theologically, however, Crocker is so eager to depict the church in a positive light that he's all but blind to its flaws. There's a lot of catechism here, but not much probing into the complexities of the church's involvement in the Inquisition or in World War II, or contemporary controversies such as the ordination of women. <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i>"Mr.Crocker's book is engaging, provocative, and eminently readable. It should be around for Vatican III."&#x2014;<b>William F. Buckley Jr.</b><br>"Harry Crocker propels us through two millennia with wit and insight. While irreverent to man, his reverence to God is never questioned in a must-read for non-Catholics as well as Catholics."&#x2014;<b>Robert D. Novak,</b> syndicated columnist and commentator<br>"Harry Crocker has written the best short history of the Church in English since the Second Vatican Council. In short, a <i>Triumph.</i>"&#x2014;<b>Fr. C. J. McCloskey III,</b> director, Catholic Information Center<br>"I used to think that the history of the Catholic Church was the greatest story never told. But it's been told now&#x2014;in <i>Triumph</i>&#x2014;with all the verve, aggression, and even humor of John Wayne in <i>The Quiet Man.</i> This is rock-solid history&#x2014;delivered with a rock-solid punch&#x2014;and is the most essential Catholic book since the Catechism of the Catholic Church (though it's a lotmore fun to read). Buy it and enjoy."&#x2014;<b>Sean Hannity,</b> Fox News<br>"H. W. Crocker III has indeed brought about a triumph with his concise and informative history. Here is a book for the general reader that provides a grand view of the Church's progress through time. <i>Triumph</i> is a book that will strengthen the faith of Catholics and give others an exciting and complete account of the two millennia of the Catholic Church.

When Impression, Sunrise by Claude Monet was exhibited in April 1874, critics seized upon the work&#x2019;s title and its loose stylistic rendering of light and motion upon water to deride this new, impressionistic tendency in art.</p><p>As with many seminal art movements, the critics got their comeuppance. Today, Impressionism is close contender for the world&#x2019;s favorite period of painting. With blockbuster exhibitions, record-breaking auction prices, and packed museums, the works once dismissed as unfinished or imprecise are now beloved for their atmospheric evocation of time and place, as well as the stylistic flair of rapid brushstrokes upon canvas.</p><p>Despite its popularity and a whole host of publications, many areas and artists of Impressionism remain inadequately researched. This TASCHEN book fills the gap, raising the profile of unjustly neglected pioneers such as Berthe Morisot, Lucien Pissarro, and Gustave Caillebotte, while exploring the characteristics of Impressionism, from painting en plein air to vivid color contrasts, not only in the movement&#x2019;s native France but also across the rest of Europe and North America.</p></p><p>Ingo F.

More than 17 million of his books have sold, and the New York Times calls him a &#x201c;master storyteller.&#x201d; In <i>High Latitudes</i>, Farley Mowat hoped to write a book that would let northern people speak for themselves and would expose the false view of the North as &#x201c;a bloody great wasteland&#x201d; with no people in it. That perspective led to resource developers abusing the land however they chose. For several reasons that Mowat explains, he did not write that book when he originally wanted to.

He hoped to write a book that would let northern people speak for themselves and that would expose the speciousness of the political idea that the North was "a bloody great wasteland" with no people in it, and therefore resource developers could exploit it however they chose. For reasons Mowat describes that book did not get written then. But here it is now, with the original conversations recorded by Mowat during that epic journey. In vintage Mowat fashion the legendary writer delivers a sweeping narrative brimming with breathtaking nature writing, suspenseful storytelling, larger-than-life characters, ferocious humor, pitiless rage, iconoclastic insights, and compassionate concern. <br>In her foreword Margaret Atwood writes: ""High Latitudes gives us, with passion and insight, a vertical section of time past -- the time that preceded our present. The choices that were made then affect our now, just as the choices we make now will determine the future. . . . It's both depressing and cheering to note the changes that have taken place since 1966. On the one hand, more damage and devastation, both natural and social, with global warming as a contributing factor. On the other hand, an increased optimism. . . But as Farley Mowat has always known, and as more and more people have come to agree, it's a race against time, and time -- not just for the North, but for the planet -- is running out."<b>Farley Mowat</b> is the author of thirty-seven books, including <i>People of the Deer, The Dog Who Wouldn&#x2019;t Be, Never Cry Wolf, A Whale for the Killing, Sea of Slaughter</i>, and <i>The Farfarers</i>.

The shocked town calls on an interrogator with a stellar reputation: he always gets a confession. The confrontation between Jason and his interrogator forms the chilling climax of this terrifying look at what can happen when the pursuit of justice becomes a personal crusade for victory at any cost.</p><p>This final novel from the grand master of young-adult fiction is one last jewel in the literary crown of Robert Cormier, who died in November 2000. In it he continues to explore the themes that are so characteristic of his work: guilt and forgiveness, misuse of authority, and the corruption of innocence. But a new book from Cormier is always a surprise, and here he gives us a brilliant evocation of the detective story, in a narrative that centers on the interrogation of a murder suspect.<p> A 7-year-old girl has been battered to death, and there are no suspects, no leads. The police, under political pressure to make an arrest, bring in Trent, a cold, ambitious professional interrogator who prides himself on his ability to extract confessions. His victim is 12-year-old Jason--the last person to see the girl. We know that Jason is innocent, and halfway through the interrogation Trent realizes it, too, in "a blazing moment." But like a medieval torturer, his goal is confession, not truth, and so he stifles his impulses for good and proceeds with the job, with deeply ironic consequences. </p><p> The interrogation itself, which forms the centerpiece of the novel, is dazzling in its elegant thrust-and-parry, its subtle twists and turns, as Jason frantically tries to escape, like a mouse caged with a python. The point of view snaps back and forth so that we are intensely aware of the shifting emotions of both participants in the deadly game. And once again, Cormier has given us an ending that seems provocative and uncomfortable--until we remember that the center of his moral universe was always summed up by the words "if only."

Although the Kindertransport allows Lily to escape the persecution she faces as a Jew living in Vienna, it means she must leave her parents and travel to England alone. As she embarks on this journey, she continues to face tremendous hardship and is repeatedly treated as an outsider. From being made a servant to taking a job as a nurse's assistant, Lily faces danger again and again until she is finally reunited with her parents in New York City. Inspired by everything she had to overcome, Lily grows up to illustrate comic books filled with powerful women, using her art to pursue her own kind of revenge against the Nazis. Effectively using a graphic novel format to tell a moving historical story, <em>Lily Renee, Escape Artist</em> puts a face to a brave teenager who survives tremendous tragedy to emerge a comic book pioneer. Although at times the simplistic narrative and colorful illustrations limit the poignancy of Lily's experience during a horrifying time in history, the positive message and historical detail make this graphic narrative a valuable resource that will appeal to young readers. Furthermore, the text also provides an extended appendix detailing some of the story&#x2019;s unique cultural and historic influences. <strong>A distinctive and useful visual portrayal of an inspirational true story, this graphic novel offers a great deal as an educational tool." </strong>--<em>VOYA</em></p> (<i>Journal</i>)<br><br><p>"Lily Ren�e Wilhelm was fourteen in 1938, a Jewish girl from a privileged Vienna home whose world was about to be turned upside down by the war. In this graphic biography, Robbins, Timmons, and Oh bring her vividly to life, describing her budding talent as an artist and her trips to the ballet and opera. With her father at the helm of the Holland America Steamship Company, money was clearly not an issue&#x2015;until the Nazis drove their tanks into town. After Kristallnacht, Lily's parents asked the family of Lily's pen pal, Molly, to sponsor their daughter to move to England. In 1939, Lily's escape from Austria on the Kindertransport likely saved her life. We know about the concentration camps, the death camps and the hardships of the Holocaust. Lily Renee, Escape Artist does not revisit these subjects. Instead, it shows us how Lily's life changed in England. Treated with disdain by her friend's mother, she was expected to do the work of a domestic servant and was denied sufficient food. Her misery was exacerbated by the fact that she could barely speak English at the time. She tried hard to find sponsors for her parents so they, too, could escape Austria. Instead of assistance, she was offered "more tea." Fed up with her sponsors, Lily left the house, moved to the countryside and became a nanny. Later she worked as a nurses' assistant. At one point, she was classified as an enemy alien. Ultimately, she was reunited with her parents in America where she found work creating a comic book series with women as the central protagonists. She built a successful life for herself and her family and lived happily ever after. <strong>This is a book about determination, hardship, and overcoming adversity. There aren't many Holocaust-themed books that have a happy ending, which makes this one all the more pleasurable to read.</strong>" --<em>Jewish Book World</em></p> (<i>Magazine</i>)<br><br><p>"<strong>Renowned comics historian Robbins pens this biography of Lily Ren�e, an artist who was one of only a few women to work in the comic book industry in the 1940s.</strong> Raised in a wealthy Jewish family in Vienna, Ren�e escaped to England from Nazi-occupied Austria when she was 14 years old. Most of the book recounts Ren�e's time in England as she's turned into an unpaid servant by her host family, works as a nanny and nurse's assistant, and endures the blitz. When she is finally able to join her parents in the United States, she uses her drawing skills to find work, eventually landing in comics and drawing pulp comics featuring bold, beautiful heroines. The story is told in a less than dramatic fashion, however. More space is given to Ren�e attempting to mop a kitchen floor than finding shelter during the blitz and being witness to its aftermath, for example. Characters' expressions and body language are kept simple. Extras include a German glossary, a brief history of the time in which Ren�e's story takes place, explanations of period details, and photographs of Ren�e and her family, which provide needed real-world texture." --<em>Publishers Weekly</em></p> (<i>Journal</i>)<br><br><p>"This graphic biography, illustrated in a retro comic book style that befits its subject, describes the life of Lily Ren�e Wilheim, a Jewish Kindertransport refugee who became a graphic artist of superwomen comic books in New York. Raised in a well-off family in Vienna in the '30s, Lily saw her idyllic childhood descend into one of prejudice, tragedy, Kristallnacht and, finally, escape. <strong>This is a smart little biography that will appeal to history buffs, comic book fans and anyone who likes a gutsy, pioneering heroine.</strong>" --<em>The New York Times Book Review</em></p> (<i>Newspaper</i>)<br><br><p>"Lily Ren�e Wilheim, born and raised in a secular Jewish family in Austria between World Wars, was just young enough to find sanctuary in the Kindertransport arranged with England in 1939. After an unhappy period spent with the family of her girlhood pen pal, she found work as a domestic and was able to join her parents in the U.S. after the war. There she found employment as a cartoonist, working on such projects as the Nazi-fighting Se�orita Rio. Throughout, Lily Ren�e is presented as a girl with understandable concerns for both her physical and emotional safety, and in relatively few pages, readers learn about aspects of postwar life including how displaced persons found work. Timmons and Oh's brightly colored art is well detailed, showing period dress and scenes in all three countries. Back matter fleshes out historical context, such as how women became the heroines in many wartime comics. <strong>With this graphic biography, Robbins, who has worked hard to bring attention to women cartoonists, offers a Holocaust survivor story that few will find familiar.</strong>" --<em>Booklist</em></p> (<i>Journal</i>)<br><br><p>"<strong>Like the comic books that Lily Ren�e Wilheim drew in the 1940s as a pioneer woman in a male-dominated industry, this biography is a tale of peril and suspense.</strong> Lily, an affluent Austrian Jewish girl, was one of the last children to be transported safely to England in 1939. After a few years with a sponsor family, she got a series of jobs caring for children and in a maternity hospital. After England entered the war, she lost contact with her parents and was later classified as an enemy alien. The tale of her reconciliation with her family in America and subsequent success as a graphic artist is classically upbeat. The book is drawn in a style that seems to imitate Wilheim's wartime comics&#x2013;gestures and expressions are stylized and formal; characters stand or move stiffly. Think <em>Brenda Starr, Girl Reporter</em>. Add to this drawing style a tendency toward melodrama and few named characters except the subject and this book might be a tough sell. Improving its odds is back matter that includes a gallery of photographs of the charismatic Lily and brief essays on subjects as diverse as the British monetary system and the Automat." --<em>School Library Journal</em></p> (<i>Journal</i>)<br><br><p>"<strong>This comic-book biography of a Jewish girl's life under the Nazi jackboot and then as a refugee is low key and that much more profound for it. The panels are brightly lit, and the narrative is crisp, both of which serve to chillingly amplify the everyday banality of evil</strong><strong>.</strong> Robbins fashions Lily Ren�e Wilhelm as a young woman who simply must make the best of being shuttled from home to home as a Kindertransport refugee in England, thankful for the kindnesses while cognizant of the inequities, hopeful but not delusional. Her parents, still in Austria, haven't vanished, but they are thwarted at every turn. Bile rises, teeth clench&#x2015;it is all so quotidian. Lily toils in this and that occupation, and then comes the wholly satisfying conclusion: Lily becomes a graphic artist of superwomen stories in the United States, so fitting that it closes her tale like the thunk of a Rolls Royce door. Robbins adds a glossary and a number of short, expository pages on concentration camps, internment camps, high tea, English currency, Queen Wilhelmina, the Holland-America Line and Horn and Hardart automats to flesh out Lily's life. A fitting tribute." --<em>Kirkus Reviews</em></p> (<i>Journal</i>)</p><h2>Second-Act Careers: 50+ Ways to Profit from Your Passions During Semi-Retirement</h2><p><b>A career guide that rethinks the golden years, this handbook offers 50+ income models for creating flexible, fulfilling, and profitable work during the encore stage of one&#x2019;s career.</b><br><br>RETHINK YOUR RETIREMENT<br> &nbsp;<br> For many people, retirement is no longer a trifecta of golf, grandkids, and gardening&#x2014;it&#x2019;s an opportunity for new pursuits that involve both earning income and exploring personal passions.

At the time, the concept of an all-you-can-eat restaurant was relatively new, and I can still remember my mouth watering as I walked around the buffet table surveying all the delectable choices: little Swedish meatballs swimming in gravy, butter cookies with chocolate sprinkles, and wiggly red Jell-O salads garnished with mini marshmallows. I must have asked my parents at least three times, &#x201c;You mean I can take anything I want as many times as I want?&#x201d; To which my parents would reply, &#x201c;Yes, but don&#x2019;t just fill up your plate with spaghetti. Try a few new things for a change.&#x201d;<br><br> Reading the first part of this book is a bit like going to Sweden Towers; it offers a smorgasbord of possibilities designed to whet your appetite as you begin to ponder your second-act career. Some of the ideas&#x2014;like consulting, working a part-time job, or teaching&#x2014;will be quite familiar to you. Others&#x2014;like creating your own informational products, training as a mediator, or working as an extra on a movie set&#x2014;might seem a bit unusual. I&#x2019;ve strived to present a well-balanced menu of options, although I must admit that deciding what to include made me feel a bit like that wide-eyed little girl in the restaurant all over again&#x2014;it was difficult to limit myself! Nonetheless, the opportunities in part one all meet the following six criteria:<br><br>&nbsp;1.&nbsp;Work-life flexibility. These are work options that can realistically be done on a flexible schedule. You can decide to work them on a part-time or full-time basis, as you prefer. Knowing that many of you hope to be able to travel or work from home during your semi-retirement, I was also careful to include opportunities that can be done on a virtual basis and steered away from brick-and-mortar businesses like restaurants, bakeries, farms, and retail shops that typically require full-time attention (and a large upfront capital investment).<br><br>2.&nbsp;Scalability. These ideas can work as stand-alone income streams or you can combine several options together to generate multiple income streams (also known as a &#x201c;portfolio career&#x201d;). For example, whereas you might be happy teaching just one class a semester as an adjunct professor, another reader might want to teach and/or write a book and/or create a webinar, and/or teach on a cruise ship. Many people start off with one income stream and then slowly add on other profit centers as their time and circumstances allow. You can mix-and-match the options to best meet your lifestyle.<br><br>&nbsp;3.&nbsp;Range of income potential. The careers in this book offer a wide range of earning potential. For example, there are bloggers who barely earn a few hundred dollars a year and others who generate a solid five-figure monthly income; temps who earn a few hundred each month and others who get paid the equivalent of a full-time professional salary; direct sales people who are happy making just a few thousand dollars a year and superstars who generate six-figure incomes. When possible, I have included income information with the profiles (current as of the time of this writing), but it&#x2019;s important to remember that, although traditional jobs have somewhat standard salary ranges, the amount you earn as a freelancer or entrepreneur is ultimately determined more by your individual effort, background, credentials, marketing&nbsp;abilities, and personal circumstances than by the restrictions of a specific job category. <br><br>&nbsp;4.&nbsp;Low start-up costs. The vast majority of the entrepreneurial ideas in this book are service-oriented options that require minimal start-up capital (often as little as a few hundred dollars and generally no more than one thousand).<br><br>&nbsp;5.&nbsp;Limited additional training requirements. Most of you will need to invest in some form of additional training (workshops, seminars, certificate programs, and the like) as part of your career transition. That said, I intentionally eliminated any options that would require you to go back to school for an advanced degree. If you want to pursue a bachelor&#x2019;s or an advanced degree, I applaud you, but I assume that most of you, if given the choice, would prefer to not have to invest in yet another expensive and time-consuming college degree.<br><br>6.&nbsp;Age appropriate. I hesitated to include this because almost any job can be done at any age, and I know of many people who are actually in better shape at age fifty-five than they were at age twenty. Nonetheless, I deliberately chose to avoid jobs that are physically demanding and could prove taxing as you age. Conversely, I favored jobs where age, experience, and maturity are perceived as a competitive advantage.<br><br> There are more than fifty different career and business ideas for you to learn about in part one. But you are certainly not limited to these choices; just like an apple can be baked into a pie, crushed into applesauce, or chopped into a cobbler with equally delicious results, each of these career ideas can be sliced, diced, and assembled in hundreds of different ways that satisfy your unique interests, goals, and income needs. As you read through this section, please remember that while the descriptions provided are designed to give you a &#x201c;taste&#x201d; of each career, they do not cover all the specifics (licensing requirements, income potential, zoning restrictions, and so on) that you&#x2019;ll need in order to make a truly informed decision. Every career and entrepreneurial option, no matter the focus or industry, comes with its own set of risks, regulations, and rewards; it is up to you to research and fully consider every aspect. I have included information about income potential and licensing requirements when possible, but the specifics change over time, and I encourage you to use the resources provided alongside these descriptions and profiles to help you continue to explore and learn more on your own. <br><br> And now, with that understanding in mind, I invite you to pull up a chair, take your seat at the table, and get ready to work up an appetite. It&#x2019;s time to sample the smorgasbord of semi-retirement careers.

Leon Higginbotham Jr. provides a welcome voice of reason. The sequel to his acclaimed <i>In the Matter of Color</i>, published in 1978, <i>Shades of Freedom</i> is a history of American racial law from the 17th century to the present. This long and often dark chronology is examined with precision, providing Higginbotham ample space to air his own view, that America has come far but still has far to go. Higginbotham, the former Chief Judge of the U.S. Court Appeals for the Third Circuit and the winner of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, is unabashedly liberal, especially in wholeheartedly supporting the concept of political districts designed to create black majorities. His analyses, particularly of major decisions such as the 1857 Dred Scott case, are compelling and elegant. And his indignation is palpable.Judge Higginbotham chronicles in unrelenting detail the role of the law in the enslavement and subjugation of black Americans during the colonial period.

In Walton County, Georgia, a mob of white men commit one of the most heinous racial crimes in America's history: the shotgun murder of four black sharecroppers -- two men and two women -- at Moore's Ford Bridge. <i>Fire in a Canebrake,</i> the term locals used to describe the sound of the fatal gunshots, is the story of our nation's last mass lynching on record. More than a half century later, the lynchers' identities still remain unknown. <br> Drawing from interviews, archival sources, and uncensored FBI reports, acclaimed journalist and author Laura Wexler takes readers deep into the heart of Walton County, bringing to life the characters who inhabited that infamous landscape -- from sheriffs to white supremacists to the victims themselves -- including a white man who claims to have been a secret witness to the crime. By turns a powerful historical document, a murder mystery, and a cautionary tale, <i>Fire in a Canebrake</i> ignites a powerful contemplation on race, humanity, history, and the epic struggle for truth.</p><p><b>Laura Wexler's</b> work has appeared in <i>The Oxford American, DoubleTake,</i> and <i>Utne Reader,</i> among other publications. She has taught writing at the University of Georgia and Johns Hopkins University. She lives in Baltimore.

He stood on one side of the dirt road, and his two black tenants, Roger and Dorothy Malcom, stood on the other side. They were shouting and cursing, their voices echoing through the Sunday-evening quiet. The noise had reached Barnette Hester in the barn. He'd stopped in the middle of milking, run out to the road, and issued his warning.<br><br>At twenty-nine, Barnette Hester was tall and thin, so thin he appeared boyish, as though his body hadn't yet filled out. His three older brothers were broad-shouldered men who spoke in booming voices, but he, the youngest, was shy to the point of silence -- except on Saturday nights, when he drank liquor and talked and laughed a little. He'd been born in the modest house across the road. When the other men his age went off to the war, he stayed home to help his parents, and his father made him overseer of the family farm. They owned one hundred acres: a few behind the house, and the rest beyond the barn. That afternoon, after returning from church, Barnette had walked through the rows of cotton and corn and reached the same conclusion as many of Walton County's farmers: it was the beginning of lay-by time. The crops were nearly full grown, and fieldwork would be light for the next month or so, until the harvest.<br><br>When it was harvesttime, Barnette would work in the fields from sunup to sundown, snatching the cotton from the bolls and stuffing it into burlap croker sacks. And Roger and Dorothy Malcom would work alongside him. As children, Barnette and Roger had been playmates. But in January, when Roger and Dorothy moved onto the Hester farm, they'd become Barnette's tenants. Once, earlier in the spring, he'd found them fighting in the road in front of his family's house and told them to go home -- and they'd obeyed. They'd walked to the fork in the road, taken the path down a small hill, and disappeared inside their tenant house. Barnette issued the same warning this evening, and he expected the same reaction.<br><br>Instead, across the road Roger Malcom charged at Dorothy. She dodged him, then ran down the road, into the front yard of the Hesters' house. As she passed, Barnette heard her say, "Roger's gonna kill me."<br><br>Roger went after Dorothy. He followed her into the Hesters' yard, and to the big fig tree, where he lunged at her again. Just then, Barnette's wife, Margaret, stepped out the front door of the house onto the porch. She watched Roger and Dorothy in the yard for a moment. Then she looked up and called to Barnette, "He's got a knife, and he's going to cut her."<br><br>Barnette crossed the road and entered the front yard. When he neared the fig tree, Dorothy darted onto the porch and she and Margaret rushed inside, leaving only Barnette's seventy-year-old father on the porch. Roger started up the porch stairs, and Barnette hurried to catch up with him. He stepped close, smelling the liquor on Roger's breath. He put his hand on Roger's arm and tried to turn him back toward the road. "Get out of the yard," Barnette said. And then, for the second time: "I don't want any trouble."<br><br>Roger Malcom shrugged off Barnette's hand and hunched over. Then he spun around and charged, his arm outstretched.<br><br>The blade of the pocketknife entered the left side of Barnette's chest, just below his heart.<br><br>After Roger Malcom pulled out his knife, he threw his hat on the ground. From the porch, Barnette's father heard him say, "Call me <i>Mister</i> Roger Malcom after this." Then he ran away.<br><br>When Barnette clutched his side and began stumbling toward the house, his father, Bob, assumed Roger Malcom had hit him hard in the stomach. Neither he, nor anyone else in the Hester family, realized that Roger Malcom had cut Barnette -- not until Barnette collapsed onto the porch. Then Margaret saw the blood and cried out, "Take my husband to the hospital. He's bleeding to death."<br><br>With the help of Barnette's eldest brother, who was visiting from next door, Bob Hester carried Barnette out to the car and laid him across the backseat. Pulling out of the driveway, they turned toward the hospital, located nine miles away in the Walton County seat of Monroe.<br><br>By then, the white people who lived near the Hesters had heard the commotion. These neighbors -- whose surnames were Peters, Adcock, Malcom, and also Hester -- were related to Barnette's family and each other by blood or marriage, or both. Their ancestors had claimed farms in this section of the county during the land lottery of 1820, and they'd set their modest frame houses close to each other and to the road, preserving every inch of dirt for cotton and corn. The settlement had been dubbed Hestertown in the early days, and the name stuck because the families stayed. In 1946, roughly thirty Peters, Malcom, Adcock, and Hester families still lived along Hestertown Road. Some of the young men drove fifty miles each day to work at factories in Atlanta, and other men and women worked at the cotton mills in Monroe -- but they remained in Hestertown and remained tied to the land and the community. On this July evening, some had been gathering vegetables in their gardens, preparing for the evening meal, when they heard the disturbance at the Hester house. Now they walked out from their farms to see if they could help.<br><br>Barnette's cousin Grady Malcom had already reached the road when the Hesters' car passed by. "Get Roger," Bob Hester called out the car window, "because Roger stabbed Barnette."<br><br>Grady Malcom, in turn, called to his brother, and together the two men, both in their fifties, ran toward the Hesters' house. When they saw Roger Malcom dart into a nearby cornfield, they followed him to the edge and yelled, "Throw down your knife and come out."<br><br>From deep in the cornstalks came the muffled sound of Roger Malcom's voice: "Who are you?"<br><br>When the brothers shouted their names, Roger Malcom said he wouldn't come out. But then, after a few minutes, he stood, tossed his knife to them, and surrendered.<br><br>By the time the brothers took Roger back to the Hesters' front yard, a crowd of neighbors had gathered. One man drove to the closest store to telephone the sheriff. Another man held Roger down while several others bound his hands and feet. Like Barnette, they'd known Roger Malcom for years, and they knew he was a fast runner -- fast as a rabbit, everybody said.<br><br>It was nearly dark when Walton County deputy sheriffs Lewis Howard and Doc Sorrells pulled into the yard. They untied Roger Malcom, handcuffed him, put him in the backseat of their patrol car, and drove off in a cloud of dust.<br><br>The sheriffs retraced the route Barnette Hester's father had taken one hour earlier, driving roughly a mile to the end of Hestertown Road, and turning onto Pannell Road. Heading northeast, they traveled through the heart of Blasingame district, which lay near the southern point of diamond-shaped Walton County and contained the county's richest farmland. In Blasingame, as in the rest of the county, farmers planted corn, small grains, and timber -- but their livelihood depended almost entirely on cotton. Since the beginning of agriculture in Walton County, cotton had been the major cash crop, comprising roughly 85 percent of the county's total agricultural profits each year. Under the guidance of the local extension agent, farmers planted only certain varieties of cottonseed and used only certain fertilizers, and their care paid off. Year after year, Walton County ranked at the top of Georgia's cotton-producing counties. In 1945, the county's farmers had averaged more than a bale per acre, shattering every cotton record in state history.<br><br>By 1946, farmers farther south and west had begun to employ mechanical cotton pickers, which did the work of forty farmhands, more quickly and more cheaply. But the rolling hills of Walton County, which was perched on the midland slope between the flat fields of middle Georgia and the mountains of north Georgia, made mechanical cotton pickers unusable. And so, despite the innovations -- electricity, automobiles, radios -- that had modernized much of rural life in Walton and its surrounding counties, farmers still depended on human labor to pick their cotton. In that respect, the harvest of 1946 would be no different from the harvest of 1846.<br><br>Within fifteen minutes of leaving the Hester house, the sheriffs had left the fields of Blasingame behind, passed a small forest known as Towler's Woods, and were entering the outskirts of town. They crossed over the railroad tracks -- where several trains daily made the roughly forty-mile trip between Monroe and Atlanta -- and drove by the town's two cotton mills, hulking brick structures that employed eight hundred white people. At times the mills ran day and night, but it was Sunday evening, and they were still.<br><br>A few blocks west, the sheriffs entered Monroe's downtown, a grid of paved streets containing banks, a department store, a hardware store, a pharmacy, and several restaurants. These were the standard establishments found in every county seat or trading center of the day, but Monroe had more to offer than most. It had two public libraries and two public swimming pools -- one for Colored -- as well as a city-owned ice plant, meat locker, and power and light system. Though a small town, with a population just under five thousand, Monroe boasted ten lawyers, fifteen doctors, and more than one hundred teachers. It was known throughout Georgia as a wealthy and progressive community, the first in the state to offer a groundbreaking public health-care program for both white and black citizens. And, as the birthplace of no fewer than six of the state's former chief executives, it had earned the nickname Mother of Governors.<br><br>Monroe's prosperity was partly due to the continued success of Walton County's farmers, who drove into town weekly to do their banking and buying. But it was also a result of its location as a midpoint on the highway that connected Atlanta, to the west, with Athens, to the northeast. Since its completion in 1939, the Atlanta-Athens highway had funneled tourists and businessmen through downtown Monroe, where they mingled with locals in the shadow of the town leaders' pride and joy: a stately brick courthouse topped by an elegant four-sided clock tower. Recently, Monroe had also earned bragging rights with its new electric streetlamps, which were aglow as the sheriffs drove through town with Roger Malcom.<br><br>Earlier in the day, men, women, and children dressed in their Sunday best had filled the pews of Monroe's thirty-six churches; the town fathers were proud to report that 95 percent of their citizens belonged to a church. After morning services, the streets emptied, and Sunday evenings, as a rule, were quiet. But on this Sunday evening, downtown was bustling. Groups of white men stood on the street corners and clustered around the Confederate memorial on the courthouse square. Some passed out pamphlets, signs, and bumper stickers; others gave impromptu speeches in support of Eugene Talmadge or James Carmichael. These were the two names on most Georgians' tongues that summer, the two lead candidates in the most hotly contested governor's race in state history. It was July 14. The election would take place in just three days.<br><br>The sheriffs turned onto Washington Street, drove two blocks north of the courthouse, and parked in back of the two-story cinder-block jail. Deputy Sheriff Lewis Howard, who served as the county jailer, took Roger Malcom from the car and led him into the group cell on the jail's first floor. After locking him in with two white prisoners -- the county jail wasn't segregated by race -- he walked down the hallway leading to the adjoining brick house where he lived with his family and secured the heavy metal door behind him.<br><br>Across town late that Sunday night, two doctors left the operating room and met Barnette Hester's father and brothers in a corridor of the Walton County Hospital. They didn't have good news. The blade of Roger Malcom's pocketknife had sliced through the upper region of Barnette's stomach, lacerating his intestine and puncturing his lung. The doctors had washed the protruding section of intestine and reconnected it. Then they'd inserted a tube to drain the fluid in the lung.<br><br>The risk of infection was grave, the doctors said. They weren't sure Barnette would live out the week.<br><br>Copyright � 2003 by Laura Wexler</p><h2>A Case of Possession (Charm of Magpies)</h2><p>Magic in the blood. Danger in the streets.

When Max&#x2019;s mother decides to remarry a bullying oaf, Max takes to the road, only to discover that his uncle Chet&#x2019;s manuals, and Max&#x2019;s near complete memorization of them, is a ticket to the stars.

Not the man with the hat or the lady with the umbrella. Not even the television or the radio forecasters. But one boy and his dog have faith that the snow will amount to something spectacular, and when flakes start to swirl down on the city, they are also the only ones who know how to truly enjoy it. </p><p>Uri Shulevitz' playful depiction of a snowy day and the transformation of a city is perfectly captured in simple, poetic text and lively watercolor and pen-and-ink illustrations.</p></p><p>Uri Shulevitz won a Caldecott Medal for his illustrated edition of Arthur Ransome's <i>The Fool of the World and the Flying Ship</i>, and has won numerous other awards for illustrating his own books. Not surprising, then, that he'd create such a lovely book as <i>Snow</i>, a touching story about childish hope, grumpy pessimistic grownups, and the wonder of snowfall. Will the snow come? (Oh, please?) In the first scene there is none, but the second has--if you can find it--a single flake. Then there are more--but they melt. And then, finally... joy! These are unusually subtle illustrations for a children's book: so many illustrators try to out-do each other with lurid effects and excessive brightness, but many of Shulevitz's exquisite panels are close to monotone. He paints whole cityscapes in a dozen shades of gray, with small human figures who you notice (at second glance) have coats of gray-green, gray-blue, or gray-brown. The adults have tiny Edwardian parasols or handle-bar moustaches. The abstract, atmospheric, folktale effect is heightened by a pared-to-the-bone text, just a few words per page. "'It's nothing,' said man with hat. Then three snowflakes. 'It's snowing,' said boy with dog." <i>Snow</i> perfectly captures the transformative nature of snow and the result is magical.

Three little gators strike out on their own in an east Texas swamp. Their mother warns them to build strong houses that can protect them from Big-bottomed Boar, who likes to eat tasty, tender gators for his snack. Soon, First Gator builds himself a nice house out of rocks. Second Gator reckons rocks are too much work, so he builds his house with sticks. And Third Gator&#x2019;s house of sand is the easiest one to build! But soon Big-bottomed Boar shows up. With a bump, bump, bump of the fierce boar's rump, he knocks over Third Gator's house of sand. It doesn't take long for that rump to bump Second Gator's house of sticks. But he can't knock over Third Gator's house of stones, so he tries another way in - through the chimney! Guess what happens to the Boar's rump after that?!</p><p>Helen Ketteman is the author of more than twenty picture books, including Senorita Gordita and The Three Little Gators, a 2010 Wanda Gag Award Honor Book. A longtime resident of Texas, she now lives in Florida, with her husband.Readers-particularly from the Lone Star State-who can't get enough of the original Three Little Pigs may enjoy this Texan transformation from the team behind Armadilly Chili. Ketteman's story features three gap-toothed young gators who outwit the Big-bottomed Boar, but the tag lines are not quite as memorable as the original wolf's huffing and puffing. When he's refused entry to the gators' houses, the boar threatens, "Then I'll wiggle my rump with a bump, bump, bump and smash your house!" The neon gators are differentiated only by a straw hat, a baseball cap, and a pair of glasses (which naturally belong to the smartest gator, who builds his house out of rocks). Ketteman adds a subtle-if somewhat didactic-message about sloth by having the gators scorn each others' building materials ("Bad choice.... Rocks are heavy and too much work").

It has transcended time and space to become one of the world&#39;s all time great success stories. Orphaned at age 4, he never attended school a day in his life as a student; yet the reading and research that he undertook to help his own children, unlocked secrets of the mind and human potential that had remained hidden for thousands of years. Jos� Silva&#39;s 22 years of dogged determination to dig out these secrets has literally changed the world. He actually found the secret of success. He first started working with his own children in 1944, then in the 1950s and 1960s helped his neighbors learn how to actually use the untapped power of their minds to get whatever they wanted. While he never asked them to pay him, he was rewarded greatly with more knowledge on this subject than anyone else on the planet. From 1966 to 1998 his Silva Mind Control Method helped millions of people worldwide, and since 1998 his Silva UltraMind ESP System is leading people into what he called &#34;the beginning of the second phase of human evolution on the planet.&#34; This man with no formal schooling wrote the book on mind development - in fact, he&#39;s had more than a dozen books published by major publishers, in two dozen languages. Prior to his passing in 1999 he developed a new course - actually more than a course, he calls it a system: The Silva UltraMind ESP System. In addition to helping people develop and use their own God-given intuition, the UltraMind ESP System includes a new scientifically-based technique to communicate with higher intelligence regularly and reliably to obtain help and guidance in carrying out your mission in life. While Jos� Silva may have moved on to new assignments, his work is still going strong, in live seminars, books, and in convenient home study courses. There are many courses that are &#34;based on&#34; his work, but the only courses still being taught that he authored himself, based on his 22 years of scientific research, are the Silva UltraMind ESP System, and his Holistic Faith Healing System. In addition to being a successful business owner, scientist, and father, he was an accomplished singer, and when he was young he was a professional boxer for a few years. You can take advantage of some of his wisdom in this book.

But perils from within and without threaten the bold captain of the Light Company - the hatred and incompetence of a superior officer, the vicious treachery of a false ally . . . and the overwhelming numbers of a fierce, determined enemy, combining to make Sharpe's escape a near impossibility. </p></p><p><p>BERNARD CORNWELL is the author of the acclaimed <em>New York Times</em> bestselling Saxon Tales series, which includes <em>The Last Kingdom, The Pale Horseman, Lords of the North, Sword Song, The Burning Land, Death of Kings, The Pagan Lord</em>, and, most recently, <em>The Empty Throne </em>and <em>Warriors of the Storm</em>, and which serves as the basis for the hit television series <em>The Last Kingdom</em>. He lives with his wife on Cape Cod and in Charleston, South Carolina. </p>Richard Sharpe has risen through the ranks of His Majesty's Army in some 20 novels and a TV series, marked by stirring battle scenes, every manner of derring-do, and close attention to historical minutiae. Here he fights the Battle of Busaco, Portugal, against the French (1810). Simultaneously he has to deal with an incompetent commander and two malevolent Portuguese brothers. Adroitly capturing character, Patrick Tull sounds like a grizzled, gin-soaked foot soldier who saw it all firsthand and who enjoys nothing more than telling war stories.

But Merlin is nowhere to be found.

Going well beyond all previous accounts, David Glantz and Jonathan House now offer the definitive work on arguably the greatest battle of World War II.<br><br>Drawing on both German and Soviet sources, Glantz and House separate myth from fact to show what really happened at Kursk and how it affected the outcome of the war. Their access to newly released Soviet archival material adds unprecedented detail to what is known about this legendary conflict, enabling them to reconstruct events from both perspectives and describe combat down to the tactical level.<br><br><i>The Battle of Kursk</i> takes readers behind Soviet lines for the first time to discover what the Red Army knew about the plans for Hitler's offensive (Operation Citadel), relive tank warfare and hand-to-hand combat, and learn how the tide of battle turned. Its vivid portrayals of fighting in all critical sectors place the famous tank battle in its proper context. Prokhorovka here is not a well-organized set piece but a confused series of engagements and hasty attacks, with each side committing its forces piecemeal.<br><br>Glantz and House's fresh interpretations demolish many of the myths that suggest Hitler might have triumphed if Operation Citadel had been conducted differently. Their account is the first to provide accurate figures of combat strengths and losses, and it includes 32 maps that clarify troop and tank movements.<br><br>Shrouded in obscurity and speculation for more than half a century, the Battle of Kursk finally gets its due in this dramatic retelling of the confrontation that marked the turning point of the war on the Eastern Front and brought Hitler's blitzkrieg to a crashing halt.</p><p>The most detailed, authoritative, and thorough analysis of the massive battle that led to the final victory of the Red Army over the Germans. This outstanding book deserves the highest praise.--Malcolm Mackintosh, author of <i>Juggernaut: A History of Soviet Armed Forces</i> <p>"<i>The Battle of Kursk</i> combines the authors' encyclopedic knowledge of their subject with a panoramic narrative of military operations to challenge the 'myths of Kursk.' Drawing heavily upon hitherto classified Soviet material, as well as German sources, the work is both original and revisionist, making it a major contribution to our understanding of one of the most important operations of the Second World War."--John Erickson, author of <i>The Road to Stalingrad</i> </p><p>"At last we have an account of the battle of Kursk from the Soviet perspective. And what an account! It is meticulously researched, persuasively argued, full of new and important findings, and written with verve and pathos. This is operational history at its best."--Joel S. A.

His forthright information and stark mental images are often disturbing-and that's how it should be.

You are leading a church with an important mission. You&#x2019;ve got a carefully worded vision statement, a set of core values, and leaders who say they want to make it happen. But does it feel like you&#x2019;re not making any real progress? Does it feel like you&#x2019;re stuck solving the same problems over and over again? Does it seem that you&#x2019;re always talking about potential, or tomorrow, or after the next hire? After twenty years in ministry, I&#x2019;ve learned that passion isn&#x2019;t enough. You can have a clear mission, but without organization you won&#x2019;t get everyone moving in the right direction. You can preach the vision, but if you don&#x2019;t have a clear path ready for people, your vision talk will be just talk. I bet you don&#x2019;t have a mission problem, or a facility problem, or even a volunteer problem. I know it&#x2019;s trendy to talk multi-site, and popular to run a 40 day campaign. New service times, new programs, and new websites are like candy that captures attention in the checkout aisle. But it&#x2019;s likely these aren&#x2019;t the issues holding you back. You can start new services and hire a branding company to create a new website, and in three years from now you&#x2019;ll likely be in the same place. That&#x2019;s because you&#x2019;re knee deep in a system problem. Streamline will help you create and implement healthy systems across all the departments in your church. You'll create alignment with your team and build focus into your ministries. You'll know what's working and why. Each short chapter focuses on one system you can create or improve. You'll walk away with actionable ideas ready to execute. Streamline will help you organize your church around the important mission.</p><p>Michael Lukaszewski is the founder and CEO of Church Fuel, and organization committed to providing insanely practical resources to help pastors lead healthy and growing churches.</p><h2>Deconstructing Anxiety: The Journey from Fear to Fulfillment</h2><p>In Deconstructing Anxiety, Pressman provides a new and comprehensive understanding of fear's subtlest mechanisms. In this model, anxiety is understood as the wellspring at the source of all problems. Tapping into this source therefore holds the clues not only for how to escape fear, but how to release the very causes of suffering, paving the way to a profound sense of peace and satisfaction in life. <br><br>With strategically developed exercises, this book offers a unique, integrative approach to healing and growth, based on an understanding of how the psyche organizes itself around anxiety. It provides insights into the architecture of anxiety, introducing the dynamics of the &#x201c;core fear&#x201d; (one's fundamental interpretation of danger in the world) and &#x201c;chief defense&#x201d; (the primary strategy for protecting oneself from threat). The anxious personality is then built upon this foundation, creating a &#x201c;three dimensional, multi-sensory hologram&#x201d; within which one can feel trapped and helpless. <br><br>Replete with processes that bring the theoretical background into technicolor, Deconstructing Anxiety provides a clear roadmap to resolving this human dilemma, paving the way to an ultimate and transcendent freedom. Therapists and laypeople alike will find this book essential in helping design a life of meaning, purpose and enduring fulfillment.</p><p><p><br>Todd E. Pressman, PhD, is a clinical psychologist, speaker, and author in the field of holistic approaches to healing and growth. He is the founder of Pressman and Associates at Logos Wellness, a psychotherapy center dedicated to bridging the best of traditional and complementary strategies for well-being. In 1982, he traveled the world to study the great wisdom and healing traditions&#x2014;including with a Zen master, a Jain family, a Zoroastrian high priest and a Sri Lankan firewalker&#x2014;to develop a new paradigm for healing which he calls deconstructing anxiety. A national and international speaker, his unique approach to resolving fear and transcending suffering has been hailed as &#x201c;a whole new perspective on anxiety&#x201d;, &#x201c;extraordinarily important&#x201d;, and &#x201c;one of the most exciting new developments in the field&#x201d;.</p>This book explores a truly profound and important area and does so in a wonderfully readable, enjoyable fashion. Its central point is well expressed by the Upanishads: &#x2018;Where there is other, there is fear.&#x2019; This notion is greatly expanded upon and creatively explored in the book, with the purpose of helping the reader overcome fear altogether, replacing it with the original, ultimate, and ever-present Oneness...whole, coherent, and unified. (Ken Wilber, author of Integral Meditation)<br><br>Fear distorts our perceptions, imprisoning us in views of ourselves and the world that limit our lives and rob us of joy. In this remarkably comprehensive exploration, Dr. Pressman helps us look clearly at our fears and learn not only to face, but to transcend them. Integrating insights from diverse psychological traditions, ancient wisdom teachings, and years of clinical practice, he outlines a step-by-step process by which we can unravel our fears, reexamine our assumptions, and find lasting fulfillment. This book can help clinicians and lay people alike free their hearts and minds to live a happier, freer, richer, life. (Ronald D. Siegel, assistant clinical professor of psychology, Harvard Medical School and author of The Mindfulness Solution: Everyday Practices for Everyday Problems)<br><br>Fear is the basic cause of anxiety, depression, anger and guilt . . . indeed, the stress reactions that are the cause of virtually all illness. Deconstructing anxiety is the key to health and happiness. This book gives you that key. (C. Norman Shealy, M.D., Ph.D., Founding President, American Holistic Medical Association)<br><br>I have a personal appreciation for the tremendous impact of anxiety, fear and phobia, so I welcome this &#x201c;workbook&#x201d; approach written by my wonderful friend, Todd Pressman. I know Todd to be a comforting and calming person, very forthright and refreshing. It is delightful that he is sharing his personal, clinical and spiritual wisdom with us in this book. This is an important resource that must get out to people! (Raymond Moody, author of Life After Life)<br><br>Todd Pressman posits that there is a Universal Oneness, a transcendent experience of fulfillment we all shared. With the rise of fear and anxiety, this original state was shattered, separating us from it and one another. In Deconstructing Anxiety, Pressman takes us on an archeological dig down through the many strata of our fears and defenses to unearth the one core fear at work below all others. More importantly, he helps us find the courage to face it head on, that we may find our way back. (Sharon Salzberg, author of Lovingkindness: The Revolutionary Art of Happiness)<br><br>A really fascinating book. I&#x2019;ve never encountered a deeper analysis of fear than what Todd Pressman offers in Deconstructing Anxiety. As he weaves together many strands of psychology and other disciplines, he exposes the lies of fear that shatter our connection with fundamental wholeness. In doing so, Pressman offers a detailed plan to turn the tables and discover lasting peace. (Seth J. Gillihan, author of The CBT Deck and A Mindful Year)<br><br>Kudos! A truly excellent book...A great book for clients and therapists. Dr. Pressman provides insight and clarity for working through the root causes of crippling anxiety/fear that block a more fulfilling life. (Peter Gariti, former clinical associate professor of psychiatry in social work, University of Pennsylvania)<br><br>An extraordinary work of love, insight and wisdom. This book weaves together various psychological models, neurophysiology, philosophical perspectives and historical references, to create a thorough and intimate approach to dealing with the fear that limits our ability to be our best. What is unique and refreshing about this work are the concrete exercises, practices and interventions, with case examples, illustrating the unique process Dr. Pressman offers us from his heart. (Bernardo Merizalde, psychiatrist, assistant clinical professor, Thomas Jefferson University)<br><br>Todd Pressman is visionary in creating ground-breaking strategies to dismantle the stronghold of anxiety. His work has the potential to promote an &#x201c;evolutionary shift&#x201d;....In distilling human conflict to its fundamentals of fear versus fulfillment, he provides practical strategies to embrace emotional freedom and curate productive ways of relating to the world. From a personal and professional perspective, the tools from Deconstructing Anxiety have provided lasting outcomes with numerous emotional dividends. (Christine Batra, psychotherapist)<br><br>Dr. Todd Pressman provides us with a book that this troubled world longs to have. With a unique integration, he maps a path for the future understanding of the human condition we are all destined to experience. This book will serve those dedicated to the healing fields as well as those seeking deeper spiritual expression.

Church takes us from the World War II years in Chicago to the vast sun-parched canyons of New Mexico in the 1970s as we follow the journey of a driven, spirited young woman, Meridian Wallace, whose scientific ambitions are subverted by the expectations of her era. In 1941, at seventeen years old, Meridian begins her ornithology studies at the University of Chicago. She is soon drawn to Alden Whetstone, a brilliant, complicated physics professor who opens her eyes to the fundamentals and poetry of his field, the beauty of motion, space and time, the delicate balance of force and energy that allows a bird to fly. Entranced and in love, Meridian defers her own career path and follows Alden west to Los Alamos, where he is engaged in a secret government project (later known to be the atomic bomb). In married life, though, she feels lost and left behind. She channels her academic ambitions into studying a particular family of crows, whose free life and companionship are the very things that seem beyond her reach. There in her canyons, years later at the dawn of the 1970s, with counterculture youth filling the streets and protests against the war rupturing college campuses across the country, Meridian meets Clay, a young geologist and veteran of the Vietnam War, and together they seek ways to mend what the world has broken. Exquisitely capturing the claustrophobic eras of 1940s and 1950s America, The Atomic Weight of Love also examines the changing roles of women during the decades that followed. And in Meridian Wallace we find an unforgettable heroine whose metamorphosis shows how the women&#x2019;s movement opened up the world for a whole generation.</p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of May 2016:</strong> <em>The Atomic Weight of Love</em> sounded like a quiet book to me, but the process of transformation from caterpillar to butterfly is a quiet thing, too, and that&#x2019;s what this story reminds me of. It&#x2019;s a fascinating account of Meridian Wallace, a science-minded woman who falls in love with a brilliant man working on big things&#x2014;in this case, the atomic bomb. She puts her dreams on hold in service to his, sure that it&#x2019;s only temporary and in these years meets other women who have done the same. Suddenly, it seems as if she has just faded into the background of her own life. Then the catalyst--a young man, both hippie and Vietnam veteran, who introduces her to many things, freedoms born of the era, and there is indecision. Ultimately Meridian reclaims herself, takes her identities over all those years and patches them together into a new and meaningful life. Woven throughout are interesting facts about human-like bird behavior and historical anecdotes, so while Meridian&#x2019;s story--a reflection of the changing role of women between the 1940&#x2019;s and 1970&#x2019;s--is the centerpiece, there are many other treasures along the way. <em>--Seira Wilson</em><b>Spanning the years from World War II through the Vietnam era and set in the breathtaking landscape of the American Southwest, this triumphant debut tells the story of indomitable, gifted Meridian Wallace--a late-blooming heroine awakened by the women&#x2019;s movement who discovers what she has to offer amid a world lain to waste by the ravages of men.</b><br><br> &#x201c;Church&#x2019;s debut will likely strike a chord, especially with women who find that not much has changed in our patriarchal society since Meri&#x2019;s time, and that Meri&#x2019;s story might well be their own.&#x201d; <i>&#x2014;Booklist</i><br><br> &#x201c;This exquisite debut is the story of a woman who must negotiate the tricky terrain of love, responsibility, ambition, and sacrifice.

But our first introduction to the Holy Spirit is not the drama of Pentecost in the second chapter of Acts. We first meet the Holy Spirit in the second verse of the Bible, hovering there, speaking the world into existence. Christopher Wright begins here and traces the Holy Spirit through the pages of the Old Testament. We see the Third Person of the Trinity in the decrees of prophets and psalmists, in the actions of judges and craftspeople, in the anointing of kings and the promise of a new creation. Knowable and discernable in the Old Testament, the Holy Spirit is thus eminently knowable to us. The witness of the whole of Scripture, from its first pages to its last, directs us to a Holy Spirit empowering the people of God, and sustaining and renewing the face of the earth.</p><p><strong>Christopher J.

Published in 1939, it reflects the religious, Christian roots of its founders, and strongly encourages those in the Fellowship to find God. Although A.A. does not consider itself a religious Fellowship, their emphasis on God as the required Higher Power discourages many suffering alcoholics from joining A.A. Do not be discouraged. Anyone, including atheists, agnostics, humanists and freethinkers can get sober in A.A. following the Big Book suggestions. Daily Reprieve is divided into three parts. The Preface provides some background on the author and his experience, along with information about the content of the book. The Daily Meditation section divides the basic text of the Big Book into 365 parts, followed by a secular reflective Consideration and action-based Question for each day of the year. The last section, Various Musings, contains some of the author&#x2019;s personal thoughts on a variety of A.A related topics.</p><p></p><h2>The PCOS Nutrition Center Cookbook: 100 Easy and Delicious Whole Food Recipes to Beat PCOS</h2><p>The main treatment approach for the millions of women who suffer from polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is diet modification, yet there s a dearth of real-world recipe guides to help these women put such dietary rules into daily practice until now.

Nutritional information is provided for each of recipe, for those who like to keep track of calories, or just be aware of the nutrition of each dish. I did substitute for some of the recipes that called for ingredients that contained gluten because I m allergic to it, but that wasn t a problem at all. 100 recipes may seem like not a lot of recipes, but there is a variety to pick from when you have the cookbook. It is a well executed cookbook that anyone with PCOS can enjoy, and find useful when it comes to eating healthy. I know that regardless of the recipes I decided to cook for dinner, it s beneficial for me, and my PCOS with no guessing in-between. Throughout the cookbook, under recipes, there are tips that any beginner or home-cook would find useful such as alternatives for kitchen tools or ingredients, cooking tips, substitutions, and side-dish pairings. The recipes are scrumptious, wholesome, and most importantly, healthy! The Mediterranean Tuna Steaks were divine, and everyone in this household devoured them with satisfaction.

This abundance of stress is impacting families and in many cases, manifesting itself in children with difficult and severe behaviors. Homes often turn into intense fighting grounds of power struggles and control battles parents find themselves in us against them scenarios with their children. Tension continually builds and before long, parents are feeling completely overwhelmed, powerless, and resentful of their children. As parents implement traditional parenting techniques, parenting in a way that most parenting books recommend, they find their situations becoming worse, not better as promised these resources. It doesn t have to be this way! Heather T. Forbes, LCSW, offers families a new view to parenting children with difficult and severe behaviors. As a parent herself who experienced dark days (and years) following the adoption of her two children, she offers a ground-breaking approach to parenting that shows parents a proven way to develop strong and loving relationships with their children. In her new book, Beyond Consequences, Logic, and Control: A Love Based Approach to Helping Children with Severe Behaviors, Volume 2, Heather offers practical and effective solutions based in scientific research, coupled with professional and personal experience. She is a master at bridging the gap between academic research and real life when the rubber hits the road parenting. This book is written in an easy to understand and easy to grasp format for anyone working with or parenting children with difficult or severe behaviors. The first six chapters discuss the principles of her love-based parenting paradigm. A new understanding of why traditional parenting techniques are ineffective with children with difficult behaviors is given, along with clear and concise explanations of the science behind trauma and negative early life experiences. The next seven chapters address specific behaviors, including poor social skills, homework battles, demanding behaviors, self-injury, defensive attitudes, no conscience, and chores. Each chapter gives specific examples of how to implement her parenting principles, empowering parents to make amazing and permanent changes in their homes. All the examples given throughout these chapters are true stories provided by parents who read and implemented her first book, Volume 1. The book ends with a parenting bonus section where more real-life stories from real-life parents with real-life children are given. These examples range in the spectrum of the ages of the children and a variety of behavioral issues. This book offers hope and healing. It goes beyond just changing a child s behaviors but goes to the level of healing for all family members. This book has the power to literally change families for life and to help families find the peace in their homes that they dreamed of from the beginning--and the peace they deserve!</p><p>Heather T. Forbes, LCSW, is co-founder and owner of the Beyond Consequences Institute. Forbes has worked with nationally recognized attachment professionals in the field of trauma and attachment since 1999. She is an internationally published author on the topics of adoptive motherhood, raising children with difficult and severe behaviors, and self-development. Forbes lectures, consults, and coaches parents throughout the U.S., Canada, and the U.K., working to create peaceful, loving families. She is passionate about supporting families by bridging the gap between academic research and &#39;when the rubber hits the road&#39; parenting. Much of her experience and insight on understanding trauma, disruptive behaviors, and adoption-related issues comes from her direct mothering experience of her two adopted children.Heather Forbes has an uncanny knack for shining a healing light on the stories of our unmet needs of attachment. With her therapeutic insight and a hard-won wisdom, she offers families everywhere a light inside the tunnel, and provides us with the only tried and true parenting formula that truly can heal all wounds: a scientifically-based model based on...love. <em>Beyond Consequences</em> is a window into a new world for us and our children--no matter where we are on our journey. This is transcendent work that invites us all to look and live beyond our ruts, stalemates, and power struggles----for ourselves, for our children, for life. <br> --<strong>Lu Hanessian</strong>, author of acclaimed memoir <em>Let the Baby Drive</em>, former NBC anchor, certified parent educator, syndicated parenting columnist<br><br>If you're a parent searching for effective answers for tough situations, Heather offers the advice you need. Another intuitive yet highly sensible voice among the very few in the parenting field, Heather speaks to the power of love, understanding, and empathy in creating a strong, solid lifeline between us and our children. She demystifies and defines the effects of stress on children that can only help us find compassion in even the worst of situations. She flips our traditional views of what is normal and abnormal to put them in proper perspective so we can behave the way our children need us to behave. <br> --<strong>Bonnie Harris</strong>, M.S.Ed. author of <em>Confident Parents</em>, <em>Remarkable Kids: 8 Principles for Raising Kids You'll Love to Live With</em> and <em>When Your Kids Push Your Buttons</em><br><br>Intelligent, empathic, affirming- <em>Beyond Consequences Logic and Control, Volume 2</em> offers much needed hope for parents and families who struggle to provide their children a relationship of love and healing. A rare book that breaks through the cultural myths and perceptions of how children with behavior difficulties should be treated. More than that, it gives parents specific strategies for changing their own perceptions with new love-based approaches for specific situations.

Numerous guides dryly catalog these trails, but <i>Best Summit Hikes in Colorado</i> stands out from them all. Author James Dziezynski has meticulously selected 80+ of the state's absolute best peaks in more than 50 superlative hikes, and his opinionated narrative brings each route to life. Each summit is included because of a notable feature--whether it's the site of a ghost mine or airplane wreckage, has thundering waterfalls or colorful floral meadows, is the best summit for spotting wildlife or bringing out-of-town friends, or is very accessible. Some peaks offer unique opportunities, such as a trailhead accessible only via a steam-powered railroad. Several summits are described in no other publication. Covering all Colorado's major mountain ranges, including the well-known Sangre De Cristo, Gore, Sawatch, Indian Peaks, and Maroon Bell wilderness areas to the lesser-known Grenadiers, Medicine Bow, and Outer San Juan peaks, this distinctive guide makes it easy to select exactly the right hike for the right day, the right mood, and the right companions.</p><p><br>Navajo Peak<br>A trip to the glacial basin below Navajo leads you to the base of Airplane Gully, where ghosts of the past await.

Amongst the peaks that grace the skyline from Brainard Lake Recreation Area, Navajo offers the most challenging standard route. Half of the hike is off-trail, culminating in a gully climb and an exciting class 3 scramble to the summit. Along the way, you'll have a chance to examine the wreckage of a C-47 aircraft that crashed in January of 1948 en route to Grand Junction. Parts are strewn throughout the gully, and a huge piece of the bulkhead rests near the gully exit.<br> Why Climb It? Shipwrecks and ghost towns fascinate humankind. We are drawn to relics, the very shells of history, which hold stories of hardship and bravery and are at the same time symbols of mortality. The wreckage on Navajo Peak is half of the appeal of this hike. Debris from the crash is strewn throughout the gully; small, rusty gears are so numerous they seem like bizarre, metallic sunflowers pushing through the rocks. Besides serving as an archive of aviation history, the scramble to Navajo's summit is exciting itself. Beginning on-trail in the beautiful Long Lake area of Indian Peaks, an easy start leads to an off-trail adventure, where you'll pass two of Colorado's permanent glaciers (Isabelle and Navajo). After a loose scramble up the gully, the remaining ridge climb to the summit concludes with an exposed but very solid scramble 35 feet to the summit block.<br> Driving Passenger cars can make it to the trailhead with ease: the road is paved all the way.<br><br> How to Get There Take Colorado Highway 72 (Peak-to-Peak Highway) to the Brainard Lake Road, which is above the town of Ward. From Nederland, it is 12 miles to this turnoff; from Lyons, it's 10.2 miles from the junction with Colorado Highway 7. If you are approaching from Boulder, it's quicker to take US Highway 36 north out of town approximately 6.0 miles and take a left onto Left Hand Canyon Drive. Stay on this road 17 miles, all the way through the car graveyard/town of Ward. At the top of the road, take a right on Highway 32 and then a quick left to Brainard Lake Road. Follow this road 5.0 miles (you'll pass a pay station and Brainard Lake), and follow the well-marked signs for half a mile to Long Lake Trailhead.<br> Fees/Camping As of 2006, the permit for the Brainard Lake Recreation Area is $7 for a seven-day pass. You can buy an annual pass for $25. Pawnee Campground fills up very quickly; if you're able to get a site, it's $12 per night. Backcountry camping requires a permit and a small fee ($5) from June 1 through September 15. Note that you'll have to go over the west side of Pawnee Pass to reach the designated backcountry camping zones.<br> Route Notes The off-trail portion of this hike is a little easier in spring, when snow covers the boulders in the basin above Lake Isabelle. Snow in Airplane Gully melts out early, so you shouldn't have to bring crampons after early May. The moves to reach the summit are exposed, but the rock is very solid. The crux of the climb is the short downclimb off the summit.<br> Mile/Waypoint 0.0 mi (1) Start at the Long Lake Trailhead and go west. Enjoy the flat trail, which is a great warm-up. At the west end of Long Lake, stay right and follow the trail to Pawnee Pass (for the time-being).<br>1.1 mi (2) Pawnee Pass Trail. Continue west to Lake Isabelle.<br>1.9 mi (3) After hiking up some switchbacks and crossing a cool waterfall, you've arrived at Lake Isabelle and the Isabelle Glacier Trail. Follow the lake on its north side; do not go up the trail to Pawnee Pass. Instead stay on the trail to Isabelle Glacier. This trail climbs above Lake Isabelle, eventually coming to a flat, marshy section with a small lake at 11,500 feet.<br>3.5 mi (4) You will need to get off-trail at the marshy section. However, do not follow the steep switchbacked trail to the north going to Isabelle Glacier. Instead, head southwest to the dry basin at the foot of Airplane Gully. It is best to stay on the left (west) slopes instead of dropping down to the flat part of the basin, as the tracks indicate. 3.9 mi (5) This is the base of Airplane Gully (12,280 feet). Finding the right gully can be tricky. Looking up at Navajo Peak, you'll see the Navajo Glacier on the right, the lumpy north face, and a steep gully that ends where the summit pyramid joins the ridge--this is not your gully. To the left of this gully is an outcrop of rock; Airplane Gully runs to the left of this rock. There is a minor talus fan of large boulders at the base (as well as a silver wing from the plane, with identification numbers). When you go over to the base of the gully, it will seem very climbable.<br>There are many loose rocks in Airplane Gully, so be careful if you are scrambling above people. It's steep, but I'd still only rate the gully class 2+. More difficult than its grade is its total of 900 vertical feet. About halfway up (at approximately 12,550 feet), the gully forks. Take the right fork, despite the fact the straight south route offers a keyhole of blue sky through the rocks topping its exit. The correct fork climbs southwest. At 12,900 feet, just before the exit, lies the largest part of the wreckage. A major section of the bulkhead, motors, gears, and wires are everywhere. Do not touch or take any of the wreckage! It's illegal to take pieces of the plane, as it's a recognized crash site. Furthermore, the heavy metal pieces sit in a loose, unstable gully--they may shift at any time. Above the wreckage, a grassy slope exits onto Navajo's east ridge.<br>4.2 mi (6) At the gully exit, the final pyramid looms before you. To reach the summit, hike up to the base of the block, favoring the south (left) side of the slope. Head west until you reach about 13,260 feet. There is a perilously balanced rock on the west side, known as the "Monkey Fist." This is your cue to begin scrambling north on exposed but solid rock. It's a short push, maybe 30 to 40 feet with several class 3 moves. Note that more experienced climbers can find a way up the face to the right (east face) via several class 3+ and class 4 sections. Novice or inexperienced hikers may find the exposure a bit unsettling.<br>4.4 mi (7) Navajo Peak's tiny summit has a register tube and a cairn. It can accommodate two people, though there are places for others to sit just below the summit. The downclimb back to the east ridge can be tricky. The safest and easiest way is to retrace the way you came, even though it looks like the rocks drop off into oblivion. There are several slightly more direct exits you can take by going down the southeast side; if you take them, you'll have short sections of face-in downclimbing, with some fall potential--class 4 stuff.<br>Once you are safely on the ridge, return via Airplane Gully. The loose rock makes this descent tough; I'd recommend using an ice axe/trekking poles for stability, even when there is no snow. Once you're out of the gully, return to Lake Isabelle, regain the well-worn trail, and enjoy the hike out.<br>8.9 mi Finish.<br> Options Hiking Navajo Peak makes for a fairly demanding day, so linking to other routes isn't really an option for a dayhike. There are some good views if you explore northeast on Niwot Ridge, which would require a left turn at the top of Airplane Gully (waypoint 6). Navajo's southeast ridge looks as if it would provide an exciting class 3+ traverse over to nearby 13,150-foot Arikaree Peak, but Arikaree has the unfortunate fate of being in the off-limits Boulder watershed. The impressive standalone peak you see from atop Airplane Gully to the east, 13,276-foot Kiowa Peak, is likewise forbidden. Fines are strictly enforced for trespassing in this area.<br><br> Quick Facts Ellsworth Bethel advocated naming a series of peaks to honor native peoples; that series is now known as the Indian Peaks. Navajo Peak is one example; others include Apache, Shoshoni, Arapahoe, Pawnee, and Arikaree peaks, as well as Niwot Ridge. A mountain was named in Bethel's honor also, though not in this range. You can spot Mount Bethel when driving east on I-70 just past the Eisenhower Tunnel, thanks to the snow fences high on its slopes, which are its trademark.<br>The airplane wreckage is from a crash that occurred on January 21, 1948. Three men were killed when the C-47, en route from Denver to Grand Junction, was caught in bad weather and was pushed into the ridge by strong winds. The crash site was not discovered for several months. There are some who believe that the wreckage should be left alone. It is my opinion one should not feel guilty or morbid for wanting to see the crash debris. The accident was tragic, but it serves as an example of how man and mountain are intertwined by the threads of fate. Like many scenes that remind us of our mortality, such an experience can also manifest itself as an affirmation of life.<br><br>Contact Info <br>The good news: the Brainard Lake Recreation Area is free from sometime in October to early June.

A pioneer in the field of UFO research and the abduction phenomenon, he is the author of many articles and of <i>Secret Life: Firsthand Documented Accounts of UFO Abductions.</i> He lives in a suburb of Philadelphia.<b>Chapter One</b><br><b>Recognizing the Signal</b><br>In the 1996 blockbuster motion picture <i>Independence Day,</i> hostile aliens come to Earth hell-bent on death and destruction. Resourceful humans band together, defeat the common enemy, and save Earth. This Hollywood scenario is not new -- it has dominated screen versions of alien contact since 1951 with the release of <i>The Thing,</i> in which a single alien wreaks havoc on a group of humans.<br>A more peaceful version of alien contact has also become a cultural staple. From 1951 and <i>The Day the Earth Stood Still</i> to 1977 and <i>Close Encounters of the Third Kind,</i> benign aliens have come to Earth to help humans. In this scenario, the aliens offer world leaders, scientists, and media representatives their assistance and cooperation. There is mutual respect: The humans expect to learn from the aliens' technological advancement, and the aliens expect to help the humans live in peace and cooperatively build a better world.<br>Still another vision of alien intervention in human life is the idea that they are coming to save specially chosen individuals from a rapidly approaching cataclysm. Cult groups who believe this have existed since the early 1950s. Members of the Heaven's Gate cult in 1997 were so convinced that a UFO would save them from the apocalypse and carry them to a higher physical and spiritual realm that thirty-nine members committed suicide to facilitate their rescue and transportation.<br>A careful examination of the UFO abduction phenomenon shows us that contact has, in fact, occurred -- but it bears no relationship to these scenarios. There has been no public meeting, no involvement of leadership, no press coverage. There has, as yet, been no assistance, no cooperation, no war, no death, and no apocalypse. The contact has been on the aliens' terms -- and in secret.<br>I never imagined such a scenario in 1966 when I first started to study the UFO phenomenon. Nor did I imagine that I would spend so many years of my adult life involved with the subject. I never imagined that I would have to tell my children not to talk about my research at their school because they could be unmercifully teased. I never dreamed that my wife would learn not to mention my interests at her workplace because her employer might think she was married to a madman, and that could hurt her career. When I talk about the subject to my colleagues in the academic community, I know they think that my intellectual abilities are seriously impaired. I find myself intertwined with a subject that I have learned to dislike and even to fear.<br>I am first and foremost a professor of history specializing in twentieth-century America. I think, read, and teach about the past, but the study of the UFO phenomenon has thrust me into speculation about the future. The study of history proves that predicting events is an extremely unreliable and usually futile task. Yet, ironically, I now find myself in the uncomfortable position of trying to divine the future.<br>My research began in one of the leading bastions of historical inquiry -- the Department of History at the University of Wisconsin, where I was a graduate student. My major professor was the legendary Merle Curti, who founded the field of intellectual history. When Curti retired, I studied under Paul Conkin, who applied stringent analytical procedures and evidentiary criteria to every research topic. I immersed myself in the study of UFOs and received my Ph.D. under Conkin's direction. My doctoral dissertation focused on the controversy over unidentified flying objects in America from the perspective of intellectual, social, and military history. In researching this topic, I spent weeks at Maxwell Air Force Base and the Library of Congress, reading government documents about UFOs. I traveled the country to interview some of the most important civilian and military UFO researchers. In 1975, Indiana University Press published an expanded version of my dissertation as <i>The UFO Controversy in America.</i><br>My early research concentrated on sightings of UFOs. My working hypothesis was that if careful analysis of the sightings showed that UFOs were extraterrestrial, it would be the most important scientific discovery of all time. On the other hand, if analysis concluded that the objects were simply misidentification of conventional phenomena and the products of overwrought human imagination, the phenomenon would be relegated to the history of popular culture. It was one or the other. To conceive of UFOs as representing a potential alien takeover was to be either impossibly prescient or foolish. I was neither.<br>Thus, I joined the other researchers whose objective it was to determine if witnesses were sighting anomalous, artificially constructed, and intelligently controlled vehicles. We scrutinized photos, motion picture footage, radar traces, soil samples, and other residue purportedly generated by UFOs. Collectively we amassed hundreds of thousands of sighting reports from around the world. We worked out a methodology to determine if witnesses were credible. I became a field investigator for the now defunct Aerial Phenomena Research Organization, interviewing puzzled witnesses, knocking on doors searching for others, and publishing the results of my investigations in UFO journals.<br>By the early 1970s, the UFO research community had collected so many sighting reports that we found ourselves with an uncomfortably huge database. We knew the time of a UFO sighting, its duration, movements, color changes, and number of witnesses, as well as the object's effects upon the environment, automobiles, electrical equipment, animals, and humans. Each of these reports were carefully investigated and documented; in many cases, there were multiple witnesses to lend credence to the evidence. The leading UFO researcher of his time, J. Allen Hynek, called this enormous body of information and reports an "embarrassment of riches."<br>Of course, there were internal debates over specific cases and fierce arguments with debunkers, but these could not discredit the legitimacy of the phenomenon. By the late 1970s, the evidence for UFOs as a truly anomalous phenomenon was so massive that I, along with most UFO researchers, could no longer deny that witnesses were seeing something extraordinary and probably not from Earth.<br>As part of our research, we of course thought about the ramifications of contact between humans and alien species. We theorized about how such contact might affect religion, government institutions, and the place of humans in the universe, but we devoted little thought to whether direct contact was already taking place, or whether the UFO occupants had hostile intentions. There seemed to be little reason to think along those lines. The UFOs behaved as if they wanted to keep their distance from us. They avoided contact on formal level. They were not making mass landings. They would fly about for a few seconds or minutes and then vanish. Their apparent "shyness" suggested neutrality, or at least nonhostility, toward humans.<br>Nevertheless, curiosity and questions about the motivation of the aliens remained just beneath the surface of UFO research. But because there was so little information, most researchers did not spend a lot of time in useless speculation. And the more we learned about the occupants of UFOs, the more difficult it was to understand their motivation. The UFO and occupant reports that began to increase in number in the 1960s and 1970s were truly bizarre. The objects chased cars, disappeared in midair, and left marks on people; they operated in secret for no apparent reason. Witnesses sometimes said that they saw UFO "occupants" outside the UFOs. Occasionally they reported coming across humanoids (the word "alien" being too dramatic and fringy) near a landed UFO who would paralyze the hapless humans and then inspect them. The humanoids were also seen "repairing" a UFO or digging in the ground; sometimes they appeared to be looking over the terrain, or collecting plants. Some of the occupants' activity was consistent with the hypothesis that they were curious about earthly flora and fauna. At other times they engaged in more baffling behavior. For example, they would pay no attention to a witness, or they would suddenly appear holding a small box in front of a witness and then disappear.<br>The accounts of these activities were a challenge to researchers who tried to make sense of them. Our mindset was not, however, that the humanoids had any hostile intentions -- in fact, they appeared to be examining, surveying, and gaining knowledge.<br>When abductions were first reported, as in 1961 with the Barney and Betty Hill case, they seemed to fit into the hypothesis that the aliens were primarily curious. Yet, although Barney and Betty Hill were not typical of the notorious 1950s "contactee" charlatans who tried to make money off their tall tales, one could never be sure whether they had invented their story.<br>As other abduction reports surfaced, UFO researchers were suspicious about the possibility of fabrication. It was easy for me to be skeptical. Most abductees had little to present in the way of evidence for the reality of their experiences. Unlike some UFO sighters, they had no photos, no radar traces, no movies, and usually no other witnesses. Their accounts were hypnotically retrieved, which was an obvious impediment to believability.<br>Because of the extreme nature of the abductees' claims, I stood on the sidelines while our knowledge about the phenomenon began to mount. The Barney and Betty Hill case was typical. They encountered the now "standard" gray aliens who communicated telepathically, gave the Hills an "examination," and seemed interested in human reproduction. Afterward, the Hills experienced a form of amnesia, and their memories of the incident had to be recovered with the use of hypnosis. The Hill case was serialized in a major weekly magazine, was the subject of a best-selling book, and became the best-known abduction case in history.<br>There was an even earlier abduction, which happened to Antonio Villas Boas in Brazil in 1957. Villas Boas, who was home for vacation from college, was abducted while riding a tractor on his father's ranch. He was made to have sexual intercourse with a strange but almost-human-looking female. This case was too embarrassing and bizarre for researchers to take seriously, and it was not published until 1966, the same year the public learned about the Hills.<br>Only a few other cases came to light during the mid-1960s and early 1970s. One was the Pascagoula case of 1973, in which two men said they were abducted as they fished on the banks of the Pascagoula River in Mississippi. During the abduction, aliens "floated" them into an object and a football-shaped machine was passed over their bodies as if it were examining them. The two men seemed traumatized by the event, and one did not talk about it in public for many years.<br>Another case occurred in 1975. Travis Walton was abducted and physically missing from his normal environment for five days. Moments before his abduction, six witnesses had seen Walton knocked over by a ball of light emanating from a UFO. The witnesses fled in panic, and when they returned a short time later, Walton was gone.<br>I read about these abductions and was not impressed. Debunkers had stated (incorrectly) that Walton had wanted to be abducted, making the entire event suspicious. Furthermore, the Pascagoula aliens did not match the descriptions given by other abductees. In 1976, I confidently, and erroneously, told J. Allen Hynek that I thought the highly publicized Pascagoula and Travis Walton cases were most probably hoaxes because they did not seem to fit our knowledge of the phenomenon. Besides, they just did not <i>feel</i> right. I thought the chances that these cases were hoaxes far outweighed the chances that the claimants were actually kidnapped by aliens from another planet.<br>In 1976, I interviewed Betty Hill, who told me something that had been kept out of public accounts -- the beings had taken a sperm sample from Barney. I found this fascinating. It not only reinforced the rising number of accounts of alien interest in reproduction, but if the Hills' story had been psychologically generated, why concoct something with the express intention of not telling it to anyone? In my mind, the abduction mystery was deepening and becoming more complex. However, I still concentrated on the sightings paradigm in which I had become fairly expert. Sightings, although still considered illegitimate by the general public, were safe and comfortable. The growing number of credible witnesses, radar contacts, photos, films, and physical effects gave us a solid evidentiary base on which to rely. Abductions, in spite of my interest, still lacked the evidence that I required for believability.<br>I was skeptical of veteran UFO researcher Ray Fowler's 1979 study of abductee Betty Andreasson. The case demonstrated that the aliens could mentally control people from a distance: They "switched off" -- rendered unconscious or immobile -- people who were in Andreasson's house while they abducted her and her daughter. This case also illustrated a physical manipulation of matter that, according to other reports, the aliens routinely performed. They came directly through the wall of the house to accomplish the abduction. And, during the abduction, Betty Andreasson saw puzzling and inexplicable images of strange places and bizarre animals. But I remained doubtful and believed that the images she saw, and perhaps the entire abduction, were generated from her mind.<br>By 1980, most of the abduction accounts were beginning to display patterns of similarity: paralysis, physical examinations, telepathy, amnesia, and little gray beings with large black eyes. Many of these reports told of a continued alien interest in human reproduction. I had read some of the abduction literature, but I was not persuaded to give up my focus on sightings. The abductees could be lying, or they could have serious psychological problems.<br>Then, in 1981 Budd Hopkins published <i>Missing Time,</i> a study in which he examined seven abductees and found that a person could be taken many times during the course of his or her life and might have "screen memories" that masked other abduction events. Hopkins discovered telltale scars on abductees, which they incurred during the abduction, and his work confirmed the beings' interest in reproduction. His book gave UFO researchers the first systematic comparison of abductee experiences and showed that the phenomenon could be studied on a society-wide basis.<br>A year later, in 1982, Tracey Torm�, a mutual friend of Budd Hopkins's and mine, brought the two of us together. I visited Hopkins at his vacation home on Cape Cod and learned more about what he was doing. I noted how cautious and conservative he was. He had been developing patterns in his research that were hard to ignore. The abductees he worked with were serious, sober people genuinely concerned about what had happened to them. I became intrigued.<br>After my meetings with Hopkins, I called Hynek and told him that I thought Hopkins was on to something important. Hynek warned me to stay away from the abduction cases because they were eccentric and led us off the main path of sighting analysis. I disagreed and told him that I thought Hopkins's research seemed solid. Hynek reiterated his warning, trying to steer me back to the "correct" course of research. Abduction reports were too bizarre for him; he could not subject them to the kind of scientific analysis that he could use for sighting reports.<br>Although I had adopted a stance similar to Hynek's for over fifteen years, this time I had to follow the evidence. I had begun to understand that if abduct...</p><h2>Penny and Her Marble</h2><p><p><strong>Caldecott Medalist Kevin Henkes&#x2019;s award-winning Penny returns in the third easy-to-read story about a sweet and curious mouse, perfect for fans <em>Lilly&#x2019;s Purple Plastic Purse, Owen</em>, and <em>Chrysanthemum</em>.</strong></p><p>When Penny spots a marble in Mrs. Goodwin's front yard, she picks it up, puts it in her pocket, and takes it home.

Founded thirteen years before the <i>Mayflower</i> sailed, Jamestown's courageous settlers have been overshadowed ever since by the pilgrims of Plymouth. But as historian James Horn demonstrates in this vivid and meticulously researched account, Jamestown-not Plymouth-was the true crucible of American history. Jamestown introduced slavery into English-speaking North America; it became the first of England's colonies to adopt a representative government; and it was the site of the first white-Indian clashes over territorial expansion. <i>A Land As God Made It</i> offers the definitive account of the colony that give rise to America.</p><p><b>James Horn</b> is the president of the Jamestown Rediscovery Foundation. He is author and editor of five books on colonial American history, including <i>A Kingdom Strange: The Brief and Tragic History of the Lost Colony of Roanoke </i>and <i>1619: Jamestown and the Forging of American Democracy. </i>He lives in Richmond, Virginia."A thorough and painstaking history of the Jamestown settlement.... Horn writes with clarity and precision, and in John Smith, he has a larger-than-life central figure... [Horn] has done a careful job of synthesizing his material. He's also strong on the details: his version of the 1609 famine...ignites the horror in the reader's mind."&#x2015;<b>Russell Shorto</b>, <b><i><i><b>New York Times Book Review </b></i></i></b><br><br>"A superb history...an exemplary account....

This work has the special merit of revealing a historical treasure--like a lost Gilbert Stewart found in the dusty attic of history, a subject whose importance becomes as obvious as our neglect of it seems silly and wrong."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>Washington Times</i> </b></i></b><br><br>"[Horn] presents the story of early Virginia almost as though it were the plot of a colorful novel....

The coffee table, which is stained and littered with ashtrays, empty bottles, and a tall blue bong, has been pushed against the far wall. The couch has been unfurled. It is a cheap couch, with no springs or gears or wooden endoskeleton; its cushions unfold flat onto the floor with a flat slapping sound: thwack. Also on the floor are several clear plastic bags containing dental dams, spermicidal lubricant, and latex gloves. There is everything, it seems to me, but an oxygen tank and a gurney.<br> <br>I am hunched in an awkward squat behind a woman on all fours, a woman who is blond and overweight. Her buttocks are exposed and her knees are spread wide&#x2014;&#x201c;presenting,&#x201d; they call it in most mammalian species. I am sixteen years old. I have never before seen a vagina up close, an in-person vagina. My prior experience has been limited to two-dimensional vaginas, usually with creases and binding staples marring the view. To mark the occasion, I would like to shake the vagina&#x2019;s hand, talk to it for a while. How do you do, vagina? Would you like some herbal tea? But the vagina is businesslike and gruff. An impatient vagina, a waiting vagina. A real bureaucrat of a vagina.<br> <br>I inch closer on the tips of my toes, knees bent, hands out, fingers splayed&#x2014;portrait of the writer as a young lecher. The air in the room smells like a combination of a women&#x2019;s locker room and an off-track betting parlor, all smoke and sweat and scented lotions. My condom, the first I&#x2019;ve had occasion to wear in anything other than experimental conditions, pinches and dims sensation, so that my penis feels like what I imagine a phantom limb must feel like. The second woman has brown hair done up in curls, round hips, and dark, biscuit-wide nipples. She lies on the couch, waiting. As I proceed, foot by foot, struggling to keep my erection and my balance at the same time, her eyes coax me forward. She is touching herself.<br> <br>Now the target vagina is only a foot away. Now I feel like a military plane, preparing for in-air refueling. I feel, also, like a symbol. This is why I am here, ultimately. This is why, when the invitation was extended (&#x201c;Do you want to stay? I want you to stay&#x201d;), I accepted, and waited who knows how long in the dark room for them to return. How could I have said no? What I had been offered was every boy&#x2019;s dream. Two women. The dream.<br> <br>Through a haze of cannabis and cheap beer, I bolster my courage with this: the dream. What I am about to do is not for myself. It is for my people, my tribe. Dear friends, this is not my achievement. This is your achievement. Your victory. A fulfillment of your desires. Oh poor, suffering, groin-sore boys of the eleventh grade, I&nbsp;hereby dedicate this vagina to&#x2014;<br> <br>It is then that the woman coughs. It is a rattling, hacking cough. A cough of nicotine and phlegm. And the vagina, which is connected to the cough&#x2019;s apparatus by some internal musculature I could not possibly have imagined before this moment, winks at me. With its wild, bushy, thorny lashes, it winks. My heart flutters. My breathing quickens. I have been winked at by a vagina that looks like Andy Rooney. I feel a tightness in my chest and I&nbsp;think to myself, Oh dear lord, what have I gotten myself into?</p><h2>The Jamestown Brides: The Bartered Wives of the New World</h2><p><p>'<b>Compelling... A real pleasure to read.' - <i>BBC History Magazine</i></b></p><br><p>In 1621, fifty-six English women crossed the Atlantic in response to the Virginia Company of London's call for maids 'young and uncorrupt' to make wives for the planters of its new colony in Virginia.While the women travelled of their own accord, the company was in effect selling them at a profit for a bride price of 150 lbs of tobacco for each woman sold. The rewards would flow to investors in the near-bankrupt company. But what did the women want from the enterprise? Why did they agree to make the perilous crossing to a wild and dangerous land, where six out of seven European settlers died within their first few years?

For over thirty years, this book has demystified prayer for countless thousands. Friendly and inviting, <em>Opening to God</em>, now available in a revised, updated edition, explains what prayer is all about, then turns to techniques that ready the soul to encounter God. Mining his rich experiences as a Jesuit missionary and spiritual director, Thomas Green, S.J., shakes away the cobwebs and banishes stodgy assumptions about spiritual life that is fed by the practice of prayer. A must-have resource, both for beginners and practiced 'pray-ers' who want to cultivate a more meaningful prayer experience.</p><p>Thomas H. Green, S.J., (1932&#x2013;2009), received his training in philosophy and theology at Bellarmine College, Plattsburgh, New York, and Woodstock College, Maryland, and earned advanced degrees in education and physics from Fordham University, and a doctorate in the philosophy of science from the University of Notre Dame under the great Irish mentor Father Ernan McMullin. Green served as the spiritual director of San Jose Seminary, Manila, Philippines, and professor of philosophy and theology at Ateneo de Manila University. He was an internationally recognized teacher, mentor, and author, best known for his classic works on prayer, including <em>Opening to God</em>, <em>When the Well Runs Dry</em>, and <em>Weeds Among the Wheat</em>. His books have been translated into eleven languages, including French, German, Italian, Spanish, Japanese, Indonesian, and Korean."This wonderful little book is jam-packed with the basic wisdom that both beginning and experienced pray-ers need to enter more deeply into God's presence." --Bert Ghezzi, Author of <em>The Sign of the Cross</em></p><h2>The Christ of the Prophets: Abridged Edition</h2><p>The unparalleled outpouring of inspired literature through the prophets came at a period of history that invites comparisons to our own. In this abridged, more accessible edition of "The Christ of the Prophets," O. Palmer Robertson captures the passion and purpose of their extraordinary writings.<br><br>He examines the origins of prophetism, the prophets' call, and their proclamation and application of law and covenant, and then devotes special attention to the biblical-theological significance of the exile. Viewing that episode through the lens of several prophets, Robertson draws our focus to the glorious restoration of God's people in Christ.</p><p>"As we have come to expect from him, O. Palmer Robertson has given us an exceptional study of Old Testament prophecy. In a day when the church is victimized by speculative interpretations of prophecy, he has provided a solid, sober, refreshingly reliable resource for understanding this part of the Bible. Laypeople, pastors, and scholars will find this book essential for the study of prophecy." --Richard L. Pratt, Jr.<br><br>"Robertson's sure touch, exegetical thoroughness, theological sensitivity, and rigorous scholarship combine to produce works of lasting value. This is another tour de force. He opens a window on the Old Testament prophets that sheds more than just light; it radiates a passion for their study and proclamation. An essential tool for every student of Scripture who desires a robust biblical theology." --Derek W. H.

The problem is that no one agrees on what has gone wrong or what to do about it. Some think we have too much government, some not enough ; some think we have too much capitalism, some not enough ;some think we have too much sexual freedom, some not enough.</p> <p>But what if the problem is much more fundamental? What if the problem goes to the very foundations of who we are as human beings in relationship with God?</p> <p>In <i>The First Society: The Sacrament of Matrimony and the Restoration of the Social Order</i>, Scott Hahn makes the startling claim that our society's ills and its cures are rooted in whether we reject or accept the divine graces made available through the Sacrament of Holy Matrimony.</p> <p>Man, he argues, is social in his very nature. We were created for community. As it was in the beginning, so it remains today. The family, formed through the Sacrament of Matrimony, is the most basic building block of every society&#x2014;whether we like it or not. We've corrupted marriage, and so we have a corrupt society. If we get marriage right, our society, through God's grace, will flourish.</p> <p>This is so because Matrimony, like all the sacraments, heals and elevates human nature. Without marriage, our ambitions toward a just social order will remain forever foolhardy. With it, the seemingly impossible, a truly peaceful and humane civilization, becomes possible.</p></p><p><p><b>DR.

For more information, visit ScottHahn.org.</p><p>"Western society is deeply affected, indeed wounded, by sin, by rebellion against God and His plan for our eternal happiness. The most deadly wound has been inflicted by the ferocious attack on the fundamental truth of marriage, which seeks to obscure and sully the sublime beauty of the married state as God intended it from the Creation. Today we must be ready to suffer, as Christians have suffered down the ages, to honor and foster Holy Matrimony. Indeed, as Scott Hahn shows in his inspiring and challenging work, only a society radically obedient, through cooperation with sacramental grace, to the reign of Our Lord, Christ the King, can truly flourish. A society, formed and animated by sacramental grace, is established and flourishes in the very first society, the family. Such a society, in fact, becomes a reality in Christian families who, by their heroic example, witness to the splendor of the truth about marriage."<br> &#x2014;Raymond Leo Cardinal Burke<br> Member of the Supreme Tribunal of the Apostolic Signatura</p> <p>"Hahn puts forward an exciting&#x2014;Catholic and catholic&#x2014;vision of society centered in marriage and family, showing reasonably and forthrightly how we might 'apply the sacramental logic of the faith to the peculiar circumstances of the twenty-first century while learning from the pitfalls of the past.'"<br> &#x2014;David L. Schindler<br> Gagnon Professor of Fundamental Theology, The Pontifical John Paul II Institute for Studies on Marriage and Family at the Catholic University of America; Editor, <i>Communio</i></p> <p>"Dr. Hahn convincingly shows how and why marriage is of utmost social and political significance.

But he also delivers a practical program for defending the family in our hostile secular world. No more confining ourselves to 'secular' or 'scientific' or 'natural law' reasons for our beliefs. While there is nothing wrong with those reasons, they are not enough. We have been leaving our best player, Jesus, on the bench for far too long. Dr Hahn says 'Now is the time to speak Catholic truth with clarity and boldness.' I completely agree. Marriage defenders: read this book, and follow its counsels!"<br> &#x2014;Jennifer Roback Morse, PhD<br> Founder and President of The Ruth Institute</p> <p>"Please don't open <i>The First Society</i> expecting a timid sermon. Hahn does not shy away from very direct criticism of secular liberalism as the culprit in undermining both marriage and the just social order. A secular view of marriage, claims Hahn, is as unworkable as a secular view of society.

Later that same year, her boy-meets-alien comedy series, Urusei Yatsura, was serialized in Weekly Shonen Sunday. This phenomenally successful manga series was adapted into anime format and spawned a TV series and half a dozen theatrical-release movies, all incredibly popular in their own right. Takahashi followed up the success of her debut series with one blockbuster hit after another&#x2014;Maison Ikkoku ran from 1980 to 1987, Ranma � from 1987 to 1996, and Inuyasha from 1996 to 2008.

But we are still free to choose how we respond to them. How can we better understand our God-given emotions and manage them so that we gain the emotional equilibrium and healthy balance we need to take charge of our lives, grow closer to Christ, and share in the joy of his love?In this insightful and easy-to-read book, Catholic therapist Art Bennett and his wife Laraine explain how our emotions affect us and how our thoughts, attitudes, and behavior can affect our emotions. In a conversational and non-technical way, the authors address these and other questions: What are the effects of temperament and our past experiences on our emotional health? Can we trust our feelings? When do our emotions become destructive? How do past emotional wounds affect our present-day emotional balance?--Outlines the Catholic understanding of emotions.--Uses real-life examples of people dealing with emotional issues.--Helps us see how managing our emotions can lead to healthier relationships with others as well as growth in virtue and a closer relationship with the Lord.--Includes questions for reflection and prayer at the end of each chapter.Emotions are a part of every human life, one that greatly influences our behavior and affects our relationships with others and with God. Emotions can lead us to acts of great charity and compassion, but they can also turn us toward sin and destructive behavior. In The Emotions God Gave You, Art and Laraine Bennett enable us to identify our often muddled emotions, gain control over them, and even turn them toward virtue. Fr. Benedict J.

A fierce partisan whose nationalist vision made him Thomas Jefferson&#x2019;s bitter rival. An unfaithful husband whose commitment to personal honor brought his life to a tragic early end. The amazing success of Lin-Manuel Miranda&#x2019;s musical <i>Hamilton </i>has stoked an extraordinary resurgence of interest in Alexander Hamilton, the brilliant and divisive founder who profoundly shaped the American republic. Now, Library of America presents an unrivaled portrait of Hamilton in his own words, charting his meteoric rise, his controversial tenure as treasury secretary, and his scandalous final years, culminating in his infamous duel with Aaron Burr. Selected and introduced by acclaimed historian Joanne B.

This book presents six principles practiced within the POW organizational culture that can be used to develop high-performance teams everywhere. The authors offer examples from both the POWs' time in captivity and their later professional lives that identify, in real-life situations, the characteristics necessary for sustainable, high-performance teamwork. Taylor Baldwin Kiland and Peter Fretwell show readers how to apply these principles to their own organizations and create a culture with staying power.</p><p>Originally intending their book to focus on fighter pilot James Stockdale's leadership style, the authors found that his approach toward completing a mission was to assure that it could be accomplished without him.

In the modern era, racial distinctiveness has been assessed primarily in terms of a person's physical appearance. But it was not always so. As Denise McCoskey shows, the ancient Greeks and Romans did not use skin colour as the basis for categorising ethnic disparity. The colour of one's skin lies at the foundation of racial variability today because it was used during the heyday of European exploration and colonialism to construct a hierarchy of civilizations and then justify slavery and other forms of economic exploitation. Assumptions about race thus have to take into account factors other than mere physiognomy. This is particularly true in relation to the classical world. In fifth century Athens, racial theory during the Persian Wars produced the categories 'Greek' and 'Barbarian', and set them in brutal opposition to one another: a process that could be as intense and destructive as 'black and 'white' in our own age. Ideas about race in antiquity were therefore completely distinct but as closely bound to political and historical contexts as those that came later.<br>This provocative book boldly explores the complex matrices of race - and the differing interpretations of ancient and modern - across epic, tragedy and the novel. Ranging from Theocritus to Toni Morrison, and from Tacitus and Pliny to Bernal's seminal study Black Athena, this is a powerful and original new assessment.</p></p><p>Denise McCoskey is Associate Professor of Classics at Miami University, Ohio. She has written extensively on the politics of race and gender in antiquity.</p><h2>Transcending Racial Barriers: Toward a Mutual Obligations Approach</h2><p>Despite recent progress against racial inequalities, American society continues to produce attitudes and outcomes that reinforce the racial divide. In <em>Transcending Racial Barriers</em>, Michael Emerson and George Yancey offer a fresh perspective on how to combat racial division. They document the historical move from white supremacy to institutional racism, then look at modern efforts to overcome the racialized nature of our society. The authors argue that both conservative and progressive approaches have failed, as they continually fall victim to forces of ethnocentrism and group interest. They then explore group interest and possible ways to account for the perspectives of both majority and minority group members. They look to multiracial congregations, multiracial families, the military, and sports teams-all situations in which group interests have been overcome before. In each context they find the development of a core set of values that binds together different racial groups, along with the flexibility to express racially-based cultural uniqueness that does not conflict with this critical core.<br><br><em>Transcending Racial Barriers</em> offers what is at once a balanced approach towards dealing with racial alienation and a bold step forward in the debate about the steps necessary to overcome present-day racism.<br></p><p><br><strong>Michael O. Emerson</strong> is Allyn R. &amp; Gladys M. Cline Professor of Sociology and Founding Director of Center on Race, Religion, and Urban Life at Rice University. He is the co-author of ten books, including <em>Divided by Faith, United By Faith </em>and <em>Passing the Plate.</em><br><br><strong>George Yancey</strong> is Associate Professor of Sociology at the University of North Texas, and the author of such books as <em>Interracial Families</em>, <em>Interracial Contact and Social Change</em>, <em>Who is White?, </em>and <em>United by Faith.</em><br><br>"<em>Transcending Racial Barriers</em> is a gem. In the book, Emerson and Yancey advance a 'mutual obligations approach' as the philosophy and praxis needed to help Americans get over their racial nightmare. They pull no punches and ask all the tough questions on racial matters, and they do so from all sides of the racial aisles. Accordingly, this book should stimulate both friendly dialogue as well as intense debate."--Eduardo Bonilla-Silva, Professor of Sociology, Duke University, and author of <em>Racism without Racists</em> <br><p></p><br>"We need scholars publishing books that demand to be debated, discussed, and digested collectively. <em>Transcending Racial Barriers</em> is one of these books. The originality here is the authors' willingness to rephrase, repackage, and restate in clear and critical ways the dominant modes of thinking about race and racism. This book has the potential to reset the ways that interracial discussions about racial phenomena can take place."--David L. Brunsma, Professor of Sociology and Black Studies, University of Missouri <br><p></p><br>"There is much to appreciate in yet another fine work by Emerson and Yancey. They do an admirable job of capturing the arguments of the competing voices in a concise and empathetic manner...this is a highly commendable book. Given the broadly relevant topic, high readability, and good quality of work buttressed by a solid bibliography, the book is widely usable for college students to scholars interested in racial reconciliation."--<em>Missiology</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Visual Data Storytelling with Tableau (Addison-Wesley Data &amp; Analytics Series)</h2><p><b>Tell Insightful, Actionable Business Stories with Tableau, the World&#x2019;s Leading Data Visualization Tool!</b> <br> <br> <b>Visual Data Storytelling with Tableau</b> brings together knowledge, context, and hands-on skills for telling powerful, actionable data stories with Tableau.

This revised edition of Joyce Rupp's best-selling book (over 160,000 copies sold) has been updated with new guided meditations for each month of the year. Joyce Rupp invites readers to join God in the dance of life. She explores twelve themes, including "The Road to Life" and "The Playground of God," following each with prayer suggestions such as litanies, guided meditations, and journal keeping.

Albert N. Martin s answer is that true Calvinism involves a sight of the majesty of God .<br><br><i>The Practical Implications of Calvinism</i> is much more than an appeal for Calvinism; in effect it is an impassioned plea for authentic Christianity.</p><p>Albert N. Martin concluded 46 years of ministry at Trinity Baptist Church in Montville, New Jersey, in June 2008, and he and his second wife Dorothy relocated to Michigan (he lost his first wife Marilyn in 2004 after 48 years of marriage and a six-year battle with cancer). A recognised evangelist, counsellor, pastor and preacher, Al Martin had his first experience of street preaching before the age of eighteen, under the guidance of elders at the Mission Hall he attended. He taught all the courses in Pastoral Theology in the Trinity Ministerial Academy for 20 years until it closed in 1998. In his &#39;retirement&#39;, he is now working to put these lectures into permanent DVD format, as well as having several writing projects in the pipeline.'A lot of folks need to read <i>The Practical Implications of Calvinism</i>. Anyone who is going to call themselves a Calvinist, in any discussion, on any of the many online forums, should have to read [this] booklet three times through each year to be able to maintain their Calvinist card, to comment online.

A safe and proven technique, the Jassey Way uses a feeding schedule that allows newborns (and their parents) a full night&#39;s sleep at a younger age than other sleep training techniques.</p><p><b>Dr. Lewis Jassey</b>&nbsp;opened his own pediatric practice in 2001 and has appeared on NBC&#x2019;s <i>Today </i>show.<br><br><b>Dr. Jonathan Jassey&nbsp;</b>has been a highly regarded pediatrician in the same practice for over eight years, and has received both the &#x201c;Patients&#x2019; Choice Award&#x201d; and the coveted &#x201c;Most Compassionate Doctor&#x201d; recognition.<p></p><p></p><p>PREFACE</p><p>Let There Be Sleep!</p><p>Why Sleep Train?</p><p>As pediatricians with more than thirty years of combined experience, we&#x2019;ve helped countless parents sleep train their newborns, with great success&#x2014;regardless of whether they were first-time parents, skeptical about the process or eagerly on board from the start. To address the desires and concerns of parents who approach sleep training from different angles, we&#x2019;ve written a few letters to them (feel free to read them all or just the one that best applies to you and your family).</p><p>Letter to the First-Time Mom</p><p>Hi First-Time Mom!</p><p>Congratulations on the new addition to your family and welcome to the most exciting, amusing, difficult, mystifying and downright rewarding adventure you could ever hope to have on this earth.</p><p>One of the first questions we ask new moms and dads we see in our practice is: &#x201c;Do you want your baby to sleep through the night?&#x201d;</p><p>Since you&#x2019;re reading this book, your answer is probably &#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; or at least &#x201c;Maybe&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. as long as it&#x2019;s safe&#x201d; or something similar. Or perhaps it&#x2019;s &#x201c;Yes! Good Lord, yes!&#x201d; Those are the most common reactions we get.</p><p>But some parents look at us like it&#x2019;s a trick question. Like they&#x2019;re thinking:</p><p>&#x201c;This is a test. Infants aren&#x2019;t supposed to sleep through the night, they need to be fed constantly, like a parking meter, and if we act like we don&#x2019;t know that, Dr. Jassey is going to report us to child services.&#x201d;</p><p>Well, it&#x2019;s not a trick question. It&#x2019;s not a test. It&#x2019;s more a politely rhetorical question, a transition question from which we can flow into our signature spiel, where we explain our sleep training method, &#x201c;the Jassey Way.&#x201d;</p><p>The reason that this question is not totally rhetorical is that some parents actually answer &#x201c;No!&#x201d;</p><p>We rarely see them, but some parents do think that having a baby that doesn&#x2019;t sleep through the night, and being miserably tired all the time as a result, is sometimes just an inevitable part of parenting. And that that&#x2019;s all there is to it.</p><p>But the truth is, we want all parents to answer our question with a &#x201c;Yes. Yes, I want my baby to sleep through the night.&#x201d; And there&#x2019;s a simple reason for that.</p><p>Our job is to look after the well-being of the child, and in that capacity, we&#x2019;re responsible for giving parents all of the tools they need to promote and protect that child&#x2019;s well-being. And one of the most important tools parents can have is being well rested themselves. Being well rested helps parents to be not only more alert, but happier. It makes them better parents.</p><p>That&#x2019;s the one-line argument for sleep training, new mom:</p><p><i>A happier, more alert parent is a better parent.</i></p><p>So we&#x2019;d prefer that your newborn not keep you up all night. Because the only way you can consistently get the good night&#x2019;s sleep you need to be the best parent you can be is for your baby to get a good night&#x2019;s sleep, too.</p><p>So please&#x2014;let there be sleep!</p><p>Sincerely,<br>Lewis and Jonathan Jassey</p><p>Letter to the Experienced Mom</p><p>Hi Experienced Mom,</p><p>If your previous child (or children) did not sleep through the night, and left you tired and possibly unhappy much of the time as a result, then we probably don&#x2019;t have to convince you of the merits of sleep training. The concept sells itself!</p><p>But if your previous child was one of the rare, miracle babies that slept through the night almost automatically, then there&#x2019;s probably not much we could say to convince you that this next child will be any different. You&#x2019;re probably going to want to ride that hot streak. We&#x2019;re realists. We know how it is. We&#x2019;ve seen it all before.</p><p>But we do beseech you to keep this book handy, because we assure you: Siblings rarely take after each other in their ability to sleep through the night without training. And there may soon come a time when you rise up and finally exclaim: &#x201c;Let there be sleep!&#x201d;</p><p>Be warned!</p><p>Sincerely,<br>Lewis and Jonathan Jassey</p><p>Letter to the Mom Who Thinks Sleep Training May Be Harmful</p><p>Dear Mom Who Would Consider Sleep Training, But Thinks It May Be Harmful to Her Baby,</p><p>We understand your concern, because there&#x2019;s a lot of misinformation out there. Some so-called experts theorize that babies aren&#x2019;t &#x201c;meant&#x201d; to sleep overnight, period; that they need to be fed on a twenty-four-hour cycle. Others will tell you that babies can only be sleep trained at a certain age, and that it&#x2019;s asking too much of them physically and mentally before then.</p><p>These claims are just not true. They might be completely well intentioned, but they&#x2019;re also unfounded.</p><p>As we&#x2019;ll address in more detail in the following pages, there is no established evidence that infants need to feed overnight to maintain healthy weight gain or development, or that being trained to sleep overnight puts at risk a baby&#x2019;s long-term health.</p><p>In reality, the arguments against baby sleep training are emotional, not rational.</p><p>Have you ever had a friend who&#x2019;s afraid of flying? You show them all the irrefutable statistics proving that air travel is the safest mode of transportation available, but while they&#x2019;re happy to get in a car, going up in the sky in a jet remains out of the question. Even they admit their fear is not rational; it&#x2019;s purely emotional.</p><p>We can look at baby sleep training in much the same way. All objective evidence points to it being safe.</p><p>So please, do yourself&#x2014;and your child&#x2014;a favor. Let there be sleep!</p><p>Sincerely,<br>Lewis and Jonathan Jassey</p><p>Why Choose This Book?</p><p>You can&#x2019;t eat sushi. You can&#x2019;t smoke. You can&#x2019;t smoke marijuana. You can&#x2019;t smoke crack. You can&#x2019;t jump on trampolines. It&#x2019;s basically a giant list of things you can&#x2019;t do.</p><p>&#x2014;Father-to-be Seth Rogen, describing a baby book to mother-to-be Katherine Heigl, in <i>Knocked Up</i></p><p>A Brief History of Baby Care</p><p>Did you know that human beings have been having babies for about two hundred thousand years? It&#x2019;s true; for as long as people, in our present biological form, have existed, we&#x2019;ve been having babies. And since we, as a species, began speaking languages only around a hundred thousand years ago, that means that we were having babies for around a hundred thousand years before any caveman or -woman could even have <i>dreamed </i>of composing a <i>baby book</i>.</p><p>But you wouldn&#x2019;t know it from reading these books today. Too many baby care books, baby sleep books included, tend to treat infants as if they&#x2019;re delicate Faberg� eggs balancing on slanted rooftops; if Mommy or Daddy even<i> look</i> in the wrong direction, baby will come tumbling down and shatter to pieces. The way these books tell it, the fact that the human race has reproduced, let alone <i>prospered</i> as long as it has is nothing short of a miracle.</p><p>Okay, we exaggerate. But we agree with Seth Rogen&#x2019;s character in the 2007 movie <i>Knocked Up</i>&#x2014;because <i>someone </i>has to lighten the mood here in the Land of Baby Care Literature. That&#x2019;s also why we had the Eagles classic &#x201c;Take It Easy&#x201d; in our heads while writing much of this book. Because the happy truth is that your baby is a supremely resilient little creature. You think your MacBook Air can take a good licking? You think a Bugaboo stroller is an indomitable fortress? These things are impressive, but could they have survived during, say, the Stone Age?</p><p>Babies did.</p><p><i>Babies</i>.</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�</p><p>Needless to say, not <i>all</i> babies survived such periods, and tragically, even in this day and age, there are babies all over the world suffering from want.</p><p>But if you bought this book, or if someone gave it to you, the odds are overwhelming that you possess the fundamental physical and emotional resources required to raise a perfectly healthy baby&#x2014;with the help of a relatively small amount of important advice.</p><p>Most experienced parents (moms and dads who have had a child before) know this already, of course. They&#x2019;ve learned it from the best possible baby guide there is: a living, breathing, growing baby. They tend to be much more confident with the second baby. But it&#x2019;s not just that they&#x2019;ve acquired a whole set of parenting skills from the first child. It&#x2019;s also the case that they&#x2019;ve learned they don&#x2019;t have to be so afraid of screwing up, as Jessica S., whose daughters are our patients, put it:</p><p>You&#x2019;re much more cautious with everything [the first time]. You&#x2019;re sterilizing the pacifier every time it hits the floor. Now you&#x2019;re rinsing it off. You realize babies aren&#x2019;t as delicate as you&#x2019;d think.</p><p>But too many parents don&#x2019;t seem to understand this. They fear that if they&#x2019;re not keeping up with the latest books and theories on parenting, and applying them to their children immediately, they&#x2019;re negligent somehow. They&#x2019;re not.</p><p>So we want to make that point up front, because if we&#x2019;re about to give you more than a hundred pages of parenting &#x201c;advice,&#x201d; we want to make sure that you understand that, should you not follow our advice, it would not imply that you are a &#x201c;bad&#x201d; parent. Because chances are, as long as you are a thoughtful parent with positive intentions, your child is going to be just fine.</p><p>And we don&#x2019;t only say that to ease your mind. We say it because more than anything else&#x2014;well, besides your child being healthy&#x2014;we want you to <i>enjoy</i> this time. We&#x2019;re not sure that we&#x2019;re eloquent enough to properly capture in words the magic of parenthood, but let&#x2019;s just say that it&#x2019;s not something you want to miss out on, if you can at all help it.</p><p>But scared parenting is like scared driving; it doesn&#x2019;t accomplish its own aim, and it removes any joy you get from the activity in the process. We want you to have confidence! As we said, if you&#x2019;re reading this book, chances are you totally have what it takes to raise a great kid.</p><p>Navigating the Rough Waters of Baby Sleep Advice</p><p>If you go on any Internet message board or blog, you&#x2019;ll see endorsements for any number of sleep training methods, many of them completely at odds with one another. And yet moms swear by them just the same.</p><p>We are confident that the Jassey Way is the best baby sleep training method. We are confident it offers moms and dads the best chance to get their children sleeping through the night. Our ballpark estimate is that, since we started coaching parents in the Jassey Way in our practice over fifteen years ago, nine out of ten parents who have followed through on it have been successful.</p><p>But you&#x2019;ve no doubt heard of the success of other methods, and you&#x2019;ve seen Internet message boards that endorsed various strategies, and you surely have friends who have sworn by other baby sleep books. So it might be helpful to explain why, when you get right down to it, <i>all</i> baby sleep books and methods are pretty similar and are all fairly successful.</p><p>The reason for this assertion is pretty simple: All baby sleep books have two <i>extra</i> guarantees built into them.</p><p>The first: <i>All babies sleep, and some babies naturally sleep through the night on their own.</i></p><p>Certainly, only <i>some</i> babies come equipped with this skill on their own, not <i>most</i> or even <i>many</i>; but we do see it.</p><p>So your baby might sleep through the night <i>no matter which book you read&#x2014;</i>or even if you don&#x2019;t read any book at all. In fact, you could be completely illiterate, and your baby might sleep like a rock from day one.</p><p>All this is to say that <i>every</i> baby sleep book has a fighting chance of succeeding, no matter what procedures it advocates.</p><p>The second baby sleep book guarantee: <i>The core of any baby sleep training method is routine.</i></p><p>Babies are creatures of habit. And they depend on environmental cues to know what to do and when. So getting your baby to sleep through the night is largely a matter of <i>conditioning</i> her to do so. It&#x2019;s a matter of building a framework of routine around your baby&#x2019;s daily life that enables a long nighttime stretch during which she is accustomed to sleeping.</p><p>Whether it&#x2019;s putting your baby to bed at a particular time every night, always reading or singing to your baby to help her to sleep, making sure lighting and other environmental factors remain constant, sticking to a consistent feeding schedule, or whatever else, you&#x2019;d be hard-pressed to find a baby sleep training method that didn&#x2019;t have some kind of <i>routine</i> at the heart of it.</p><p>When we combine these two certainties&#x2014;that some babies will sleep through the night on their own, and that getting any baby used to a daily routine increases the chances that that baby will sleep through the night&#x2014;we can see why <i>any </i>baby sleep book or method has at least a decent chance of success.</p><p>And since this is such a personal issue for moms and dads, it&#x2019;s easy to understand how, if one method works for a particular family, they might come to trumpet that method and critique others&#x2014;even if they have no personal experience with them.</p><p>Now that we&#x2019;ve explained how we&#x2019;re not special, let&#x2019;s talk about how we are.</p><p>WE KEEP IT REAL</p><p>We don&#x2019;t mean to brag, but: We never intended to write a book about baby sleep. We are in this to help babies and parents. When it comes to baby sleep, we 100 percent keep it real.</p><p>Our sleep training method, the Jassey Way, was something we would simply explain to the parents we saw in our pediatric practice. We&#x2019;d ask, &#x201c;Do you want your baby to sleep through the night?&#x201d; and if the answer was &#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; we would explain our method. We were happy when the parents reported back to us that it was successful, but our baby sleep ambitions never extended beyond the walls of our office in Bellmore, Long Island.</p><p>But over the years, more and more parents we saw in our practice started telling us, &#x201c;You have to write a book about it,&#x201d; in reference to our sleep method. Eventually, enough of them said it that we decided to do it.</p><p>So you see, the Jassey Way wasn&#x2019;t developed from studies, or lab tests, and it hasn&#x2019;t been &#x201c;proven&#x201d; by them, either. It comes from the sum total of treating more than fifteen thousand babies over the course of more than thirty years combined of practicing pediatrics.</p><p>The bottom line: The Jassey Way has worked for the families we treat. It&#x2019;s worked for enough of them that we can say, with confidence, that it should work for <i>most </i>babies; it&#x2019;s more a matter of whether or not you want to <i>use</i> our method, than of whether or not it will work.</p><p>THE PROCESS IS STRAIGHTFORWARD</p><p>Some baby sleep books read more like incredibly detailed manuals for do-it-yourself furniture or electronics assembly.</p><p>We&#x2019;re talking about the books that advocate Olympic figure skating&#x2013;like routines surrounding the nightly act of putting the child to bed: meticulous, time-consuming multistep procedures involving highly calibrated lighting, scripted spoken lines, check-ins at various intervals, keeping sleeping logs&#x2014;those sorts of things. We&#x2019;re talking about sleep training methods that might succeed by making you a MD/PhD in baby sleep, when all you need is a little undergrad-level summer course.</p><p>In contrast, the Jassey Way is very structured, sure, but it is not at all complicated, complex, or particularly demanding of your time.</p><p>WE&#x2019;RE ALL ABOUT COULD, NOT SHOULD</p><p></p></p><h2>Herman the Helper</h2><p>Herman the helpful octopus is always willing to assist anyone who needs his help--old or young, friend or enemy</p><p>Robert Kraus, <i>New Yorker</i> cartoonist and cover artist, created numerous classic picture books for very young children, including <i>Leo the Late Bloomer</i> and <i>Milton the Early Riser.</i><br><br>Jose Aruego and Ariane Dewey have illustrated many books together&#x2014;he draws the outlines and designs the pages; she paints the illustrations.

Published in 1884 by the English clergyman and headmaster Edwin A. Abbott, it is the fanciful tale of A. Square, a two-dimensional being who is whisked away by a mysterious visitor to The Land of Three Dimensions, an experience that forever alters his worldview.<p>Like the original, Ian Stewart's commentary takes readers on a strange and wonderful journey. With clarity and wit, Stewart illuminates Abbott's numerous Victorian references and touches on such diverse topics as ancient Babylon, Karl Marx, Mary Shelley's <i>Frankenstein</i>, Mt. Everest, H.G. Wells, and phrenology. <i>The Annotated Flatland</i> makes fascinating connections between <i>Flatland</i> and Abbott's era, resulting in a classic to rival Abbott's own, and a book that will inspire and delight curious readers for generations to come.</p></p><p>The product of an agreeably dotty cleric named Edwin Abbott Abbott and first published in 1884, <i>Flatland</i> distills all that the Victorian era knew of higher mathematics--and then some--into a witty, complex novel of ideas.<p> Ian Stewart, the author of the equally witty sequel, <i>Flatterland</i>--which adds to Abbott's store of science the key discoveries made since--does a superb job of explaining the original book's enigmas, allusions, ironies, implausibilities, and what Douglas Hofstadter would call "metamagical themas." Among other things, Stewart comments on Abbott's comments on such things as the nature/nurture controversy, the fourth dimension and beyond, the role of multidimensional spaces in economic systems, infinite series and perfect squares, celestial mechanics, and other matters close to the hearts of cosmologists and science buffs alike.</p><p> Stewart's notes make an entertaining and learned addition to an already classic bit of writing--one that has never been out of print since its first publication. For both devoted Abbott fans and newcomers to his work, this is the edition to have. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p><b>Edwin A. Abbott</b> was born in London on December 20, 1838.

Each morning, she wakes up on the wrong side of the bed, puts on her ugliest dress, eats spider mush for breakfast, and brushes her teeth with candy. Then she looks in the mirror and happily observes, You are utterly repulsive!&#x201d; As soon as she leaves the house, she begins to spread her misery. No one is safe from her rainy-day spells or her wart-growing charms!<br><br>But one night, Brunhilda&#x2019;s cat makes trouble instead.<br><br>When Brunhilda wakes up that next morning, she is on the <i>right</i> side of the bed. All she can find to wear is a fluffy pink ball gown. And her spider mush is replaced with oatmeal; her candy replaced by toothpaste! The day has gone completely backwards. What will happen when Brunhilda casts her all-time favorite misery-inducing spells?<br><br>This is a silly story about how sometimes being nice can be more rewarding than being mean. Brunhilda may decide to keep some of her warts in the end, but she&#x2019;s a changed witch.

Having been naked in films or naked in photo shoots, it&#x2019;s nothing compared to singing. It&#x2019;s absolute nakedness. You are stripped bare! It&#x2019;s very strange. Acting seems much easier, in fact, because you are putting on a costume&#x2014;whereas here, you are taking everything off.<br> <br>&#x2014;Lou Doillon<br> <br>I can speak from experience that our singing voice is deeply entwined with our core identities, a kind of shamanic tool that we can use to explore and heal the hidden parts of ourselves. Before I released my first album, Reveal, in 2004, I had never really shared my singing voice publicly. Singing for me had been a lifelong dream that, up to that point, had only found expression in the devotional chanting practices that were an essential part of my daily spiritual life. Chanting with the harmonium (Indian reed organ) in front of my home altar was and still is a deeply personal, intimate expression of singing. In that setting, it&#x2019;s just you and Spirit; you can sing freely, just for the joy of it. However, singing like that in front of a room full of people was something altogether new and unfamiliar.<br> <br>I knew I had a profound calling to sing and to share these songs that were coming forth like musical flowers from this living plant of daily chanting practice that I&#x2019;d been nurturing for more than a decade. Just after returning to California after my second trip to India, at a time when I was making part of my living as a professional tabla (Indian hand drums) player and had just recorded Live on Earth with Krishna Das, I awoke to the sound of that calling loud and clear in the form of an inner voice that said, Unless you sing, you&#x2019;ll never truly be happy. My mind did a quick fast-forward through a hypothetical version of my life that didn&#x2019;t include singing, and I saw with utter clarity that, at the end, I would be filled with regret that I hadn&#x2019;t taken this leap of faith to free my voice.<br> <br>That day, I put aside the tablas I&#x2019;d been practicing devotedly for three to four hours daily, resolved that I could still keep my drumming skills intact with just an hour a day or so. In their place, I began the journey of finding my voice&#x2014;spending hours every day singing with my harmonium or guitar, practicing the Indian sargam vocal scales I had learned at the Ali Akbar College of Music, writing new mantra-based songs (beginning with the song Ma), and even taking a few voice lessons here and there to help guide me on my way. Most of all, I dove deeper and deeper into my daily chanting practice. That practice formed the foundation for the way I approached singing and fueled the inspiration for the songs that came through me.<br> <br>When Reveal was released in 2004, the fifty-four minutes of music on that first album were the songs born from that period in my life. Even though I&#x2019;d already been through the process of writing, recording, and producing at that point, until Reveal hit the streets, those songs and, more importantly, my singing voice, had so far existed solely in a kind of protective bubble into which only I, my family, and the musicians and singers who recorded with me had been allowed. As far as everyone else was concerned, I was still the little drummer boy who played tablas for kirtan (a form of call-and-response chanting) singers like Krishna Das or Wah. It was one thing to sing at home or even in the recording studio but, with the release of Reveal, it felt as if I was allowing my voice to be heard by anyone in the world who chose to listen. On one hand, I felt exuberant to finally be able to share this musical offering and to let the world know that the little drummer boy had found his voice. On the other hand, putting this music out for everyone to hear felt a bit like walking down Santa Monica Boulevard stark naked in broad daylight. You can see why the album title was an obvious choice.<br> <br>The very same week that Reveal came out, I had another debut of sorts, this one in the form of a red rash that appeared suddenly all over my neck, chest, and back. A friend who saw me around that time took a look at my red, inflamed neck and said, &#x201c;Oh, wow. You look like you could be a Cardassian from Star Trek. It&#x2019;s kind of cool, actually.&#x201d; Finding myself inexplicably covered in a red, itchy rash was definitely not cool, however, because just as this new phase of my musical life was getting under way, the discomfort of this bizarre skin issue had suddenly made my day-to-day reality a challenge. I found it hard to sleep at night and even the touch of a shirt against my chest was incredibly irritating. I was miserable.<br> <br>After a couple of visits to Western doctors, it became clear that the only strategy they were really offering was to suppress the rash temporarily with steroids&#x2014;not a long-term solution. So, I set about looking for a more holistic approach that held out the possibility of real healing. I found a great acupuncturist/herbalist in Los Angeles and went in for the initial consultation. She examined me and listened sympathetically as I rattled off my litany of symptoms for her. At the end of that very first session, she reassured me and said she was confident that we could resolve whatever was creating this imbalance in my body through herbs, acupuncture, and dietary changes. I felt the first glimmer of hope that I might finally get some relief from the suffering I&#x2019;d been going through. That&#x2019;s when she dropped a bit of holistic jujitsu on me: &#x201c;You know, in Chinese medicine, we like to say that an illness is the body&#x2019;s way of asking you a question. Maybe your question is, &#x2018;Are you comfortable in your own skin?&#x2019; &#x201d;<br> <br>Those words landed like a big stone in the middle of a lake, sending ripples out in every direction. It suddenly dawned on me that what was going on with my skin could be a kind of dramatic externalization of an underlying psychological or energetic blockage that was just coming to the surface&#x2014;literally&#x2014;to be healed. I felt daunted at the prospect that my healing from this uncomfortable condition wouldn&#x2019;t come in the form of a quick-fix prescription but, instead, would require me to evolve somehow, to embody myself more fully. Even so, I felt a sense of confidence and strength begin to come over me because I knew that I had a powerful ally to help me through the process: my singing and chanting practice.<br> <br>Over the next nine months, with Reveal starting to find its way into the iPods and ears of people all around California and then beyond, I began playing my first concerts as a singer, still contending with the discomfort of the rash. At first, singing in front of an audience felt strange and a little intimidating, but the more I tried to cultivate the same feeling I would have chanting alone in front of my altar, the more natural and comfortable it felt. I began to notice that, while I was deeply in that sacred space of chanting, all the discomfort from the rash would vanish. At the end of those nine months, during a kirtan on the Big Island of Hawaii, the redness and irritation that had been my constant companion and fierce teacher for the better part of a year finally disappeared from my body.<br> Finding Your Voice<p></p> <br>At this point I feel like I should insert one of those caveats you see at the end of those stock market trading services commercials with the message, &#x201c;These results are not typical. Actual results will vary.&#x201d; Just to put your mind at ease, among the thousands of people I&#x2019;ve encountered who&#x2019;ve taken the journey to find their true voice, so far I&#x2019;m the only one whose process included a temporary Cardassian neck tattoo. What finding our voice does give each and every one of us, though, is an opportunity to know ourselves more fully. Through the physical aspect of learning how to sing, we become more deeply aware of this physical instrument of our body; we begin to tune in to the deeper patterns of thought and feeling within us, and how those patterns are showing up in our body. By tuning into ourselves in this way through singing, we have a place from which we start expressing and releasing things. It&#x2019;s simple and direct.<br> <br>The powerful transformative effect of releasing our voice is familiar territory for music therapists like Daniel Comstock, the director for the Center for Attitudinal Healing &amp; the Arts in Montana. He describes the process of singing in a safe, judgment-free environment as an opportunity for our mind, body, and emotions to join, to come into alignment, which allows for healing. &#x201c;If I&#x2019;m aware that I&#x2019;m using my body to express my emotions, then it&#x2019;s easier to let those emotions out. Well, if I&#x2019;m singing a good piece of music or singing a chant that resonates with me, then those feelings start flowing through me. They stop being blocked. They stop being held. A good song along with a good sense of being fully in your body will start that process because you&#x2019;re connecting with yourself. By connecting with yourself, the truth of you&#x2014;which is love&#x2014;is going to be experienced and manifested. For me, my relationship to God and to the Universe is found through these actual concrete experiences of breathing and healing and singing and being and loving.&#x201d;1<br> <br>As we embark on this healing journey to connect with our own singing voice, we&#x2019;ll begin with some amazing and inspiring insights about the power of singing. We&#x2019;ll discover how it&#x2019;s possible for the heartbeats of a group of singers to actually sync up to the same cardiovascular rhythm. We&#x2019;ll learn whether or not amateur singers can reap the same or even greater benefits from singing than professionals. And we&#x2019;ll see what an ancient Buddhist mantra has in common with the Christian Ave Maria prayer. In the next chapter, we&#x2019;ll explore together exactly how singing, chanting, and mantra affect our physical, emotional, and psychological well-being, our adaptability and longevity, and how we can cultivate and boost those life-enhancing properties of these fun and functional practices.<br> <br>Music expresses that which cannot be put into words and that which cannot remain silent.<br> <br>&#x2014;VICTOR HUGO</p><h2>The Seven Sisters of the Pleiades: Stories from Around the World</h2><p>The legends of the Seven Sisters of the Pleiades that poets, priests, prophets, shamans, storytellers, artists, singers, and historians have told throughout time are retold in this compilation of the stories that have found their inspiration in nine beautiful stars clustered together in the night sky.

With Store Front II they&#39;ve continued their documentation of an important cross-section of New York&#39;s &#34;Mom and Pop&#34; economy. The Murray&#39;s penetrating photographs are only half the story though. Their copious background texts, gleaned largely from interviews with the stores&#39; owners and employees, bring wonderful color and nuance to the importance of these unique one-off establishments. The Murrays have rendered the out of the way bodegas, candy shops and record stores just as faithfully as the historically important institutions and well known restaurants, bars and cafes. From the Stonewall Inn to the Brownsville Bike Shop and The Pink Pussycat to Smith and Wolensky, the Murrays reveal how New York&#39;s long-standing businesses stand in sharp contrast to the city&#39;s rapidly evolving corporate facade. The authors&#39; landmark 2008 book, Store Front, was recently cited in Bookforum&#39;s 20th Anniversary issue as having &#34;demonstrated the paradoxical power of digital photo editing to alter actual views in order for us to see more clearly what is really there.&#34; James and Karla Murray live in New York City and were awarded the New York Society Library&#39;s prestigious New York City book award in 2012 for their last book, New York Nights.</p><p></p><h2>Your Life After Their Death: A Medium&#39;s Guide to Healing After a Loss</h2><p>In&nbsp;<b><i>Your Life After Their Death</i></b>, psychic medium&nbsp;<b>Karen No�</b>&nbsp;shows you how to move on and enjoy life again after you've lost a loved one.

But the dizzying pace of innovation, combined with a dearth of evidence on the effectiveness of new tools and programs, challenges educators to articulate how technology can best fit into the learning experience. <i>Minds Online</i> is a concise, nontechnical guide for academic leaders and instructors who seek to advance learning in this changing environment, through a sound scientific understanding of how the human brain assimilates knowledge.</p><p>Drawing on the latest findings from neuroscience and cognitive psychology, Michelle Miller explores how attention, memory, and higher thought processes such as critical thinking and analytical reasoning can be enhanced through technology-aided approaches. The techniques she describes promote retention of course material through frequent low-stakes testing and practice, and help prevent counterproductive cramming by encouraging better spacing of study. Online activities also help students become more adept with cognitive aids, such as analogies, that allow them to apply learning across situations and disciplines. Miller guides instructors through the process of creating a syllabus for a cognitively optimized, fully online course. She presents innovative ideas for how to use multimedia effectively, how to take advantage of learners&#x2019; existing knowledge, and how to motivate students to do their best work and complete the course.</p><p>For a generation born into the Internet age, educational technology designed with the brain in mind offers a natural pathway to the pleasures and rewards of deep learning.</p></p><p>Michelle D. Miller is Co-Director of the First Year Learning Initiative and Professor of Psychology at Northern Arizona University.&#x201c;If you teach with technology in any form, at any level, I recommend you put this book at the top of yourtottering pile of required reading on higher education. It&#x2019;s an outstanding book that provides a road map for truly effective online teaching. What distinguishes [Miller&#x2019;s] book from much of the research available on teaching with technology, and pushes it beyond arguments about improving access, is her emphasis on the ways in which online teaching tools can actually improve learning for <i>all</i> students&#x2015;not just those who have no access to traditional face-to-face classrooms.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>James Lang</b><b>, </b><b><i>Chronicle of Higher Education</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;As an expert in the cognitive science of learning and an award-winning educator, Miller is well-poised to bridge the gap between science and practice. <i>Minds Online</i> translates principles and findings from cognitive science into concrete, actionable tips and recommendations for educators trying to incorporate technology into their teaching. This is a terrific book.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Sean Kang, Dartmouth College</b><br><br>&#x201c;<i>Minds Online</i> is important and relevant for teachers, instructional designers, and the general public. The book is written in a friendly, conversational style, and Miller brings together a broad knowledge of the field, grounded in her experiences as an instructor and cognitive scientist.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Richard E.

Like previous editions, it focuses on real problems and real administrative practice. Problems serve as the primary pedagogical tool, including problems that do not involve courts. The book raises ethical issues distinctive to government lawyers, requires students to parse statutory and regulatory text in solving problems, and orients the course around administrative law practice rather than theory. While theory is not ignored, the book focuses on reality-based problems that put theory in context. It includes the most recent important Supreme Court and Courts of Appeals cases, including <i>King v. Burwell</i>, with its rejection of <i>Chevron</i> when a case involves interpretive questions of deep &#x201c;economic and political significance&#x201d;; <i>Perez v. Mortgage Bankers Ass'n</i>, which overruled the D.C. Circuit's <i>Alaska Hunters</i> line of cases; <i>Lexmark International</i>'s attempt to clarify the meaning of prudential standing; <i>Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins</i>, with its rejection of standing absent concrete injury to a person, even when a person's statutory right has been violated; and <i>Corps of Engineers v. Hawkes'</i> elaboration of the test for finality.<br><br>Notably, the new edition joins the ranks of Interactive Casebooks, a new breed of casebook that features a novel visual display and layout that uses text boxes, and color/border segregated feature sections for hypotheticals, reference to scholarly debates, useful information for students, and provocative questions. A major distinguishing feature of the book is its inclusion of an accompanying electronic version with the extensive hyperlinking to Westlaw versions of legal materials, Black's Law Dictionary definitions, supplementary online resources and more. The 6th Edition utilizes the CasebookPlus&#x2122; platform, providing students with digital access to faculty-authored self-assessments that are keyed to the text.</p><p></p><h2>Democratic Discord in Schools: Cases and Commentaries in Educational Ethics</h2><p>Teaching in a democracy is challenging and filled with dilemmas that have no easy answers.

These sacred gestures of the hands and body create a tangible link between body and mind, conscious and unconscious, and can be used to strengthen and invigorate specific organs or bodily systems. <br> <br>Exploring the mudras of sexual vitality, Serge Villecroix illustrates energy movement exercises for men and women to tone the genitals, increase libido, improve endurance, and enhance pleasure. He reveals mudras for men to reach orgasm without ejaculation and details shared exercises for couples to harmonize male and female energies. He explains how these exercises can treat sexual dysfunction, such as impotence, as well as overcome sexual problems caused by tobacco, psychotropic drugs, alcohol, and other substances. Providing a complete guide to the sex mudras, Villecroix shows how strengthening your sexual energies also improves cardiac and respiratory health and overall vitality.</p><p>Serge Villecroix is a practitioner of traditional Chinese medicine, smoking cessation coach, and former therapist. He lectures throughout France on the mudras, energy healing, and traditional Chinese medicine. The author of nine books in French, he lives in France.<b>Introduction</b> <br> <br>The era we live in is paradoxical; for several decades now sexuality has been liberated, and young people have their first intimate experiences earlier and earlier, while at the same time we fail to nourish ourselves in a way that promotes the positive energies that are so very necessary for harmonious sexuality. When we speak of nourishment here, we mean that of the flesh, but without forgetting the importance of nourishment on the spiritual plane as well. <br> <br>In order for sexuality to blossom, it is necessary to channel it, sometimes even to control it, then certain energies will come forth to reveal all the potential of the most sacred love. At that point spirit, soul, and body will be one. A gentle and profound connection will unite the two lovers inseparably, whatever their age and sexes may be. <br> <br>The exercises presented in this book are unusually simple, and in order not to make their practice strenuous, it is necessary to meditate upon them slowly so that the flame of desire may be appropriately channeled and the senses not be excited too frequently. <br> <br>With regular practice, the lovers of the world--to whom this book is dedicated--will be certain to observe good effects from these exercises, which have already been known in Asia for millennia. <br> <br>I contemplated an appropriate title for this book for a long time and then decided upon the word mudra--the feminine word used in ancient Buddhism, Tantrism, and traditional dance in India. Why such care in choosing this term? Simply because a mudra is better known in the West as a placement of the hands--one upon the other--over a part of the body. The Sanskrit word <i>mudra</i> can be translated as &#x201c;seal&#x201d; or &#x201c;sign,&#x201d; a position of the body, or symbolic gesture of the hand. Asian peoples regard a mudra as a movement. A sexual mudra, therefore, is simply a gesture or movement used for sex. <br> <br>In this book sexuality is not relegated to the role of a simple physiological outlet. It is based on an analysis of the energies inherent to this practice and the attention that partners must pay to one another in order for their sex life to flourish. <br> <br><b>Mudras for Couples to Practice Together</b> <br> <br><b>Exercise 31.</b> Mudra for Harmonizing Feminine and Masculine Energies <br><b>Exercise 32.</b> Mudra for Harmonizing Renal Energy <br><b>Exercise 33.</b> Ear Mudra <br><b>Exercise 34.</b> Mudra to Relieve Frigidity <br><b>Exercise 35.</b> Kissing Mudra <br> <br><b>31 <br>Mudra for Harmonizing Feminine and Masculine Energies</b> <br> <br>This mudra can be practiced for three purposes. First, it stimulates relations between the two partners. Second, it augments the circulation of energy. Third, it harmonizes the energies between the two partners. <br> <br>It is also a marvelous introduction and a delicious conclusion. <br> <br><b>Exercise</b> <br>- Lying down, face to face, embracing each other closely, each of you should place your right hand on the base of the other&#x2019;s spine and your left hand on the base of the other&#x2019;s skull. <br> <br>- Be sure to get as close as possible, depending on your relative heights, in order to facilitate the circulation of energy. <br> <br>- Slowly, each of you should contract your anuses in order to maintain basal energy and allow the energy to rise up to spread throughout the entire body. <br> <br>- Stay like this for several moments, eyes closed and breathing together slowly and calmly. <br> <br>- Then, open your eyes and stare into each other&#x2019;s eyes without speaking at all. Try smiling at each other, which will open the eyes wider, corresponding to the windows of the soul. <br> <br>- Gently rub your noses together using slow and tender movements. <br> <br>- Then, put your tongue into the mouth of your partner--softly and gently--and move your tongues together in order to allow all the energy you have accumulated to circulate throughout your entire bodies. <br> <br><b>First Variation</b> <br>Practice this mudra of global energy harmonization right at the beginning of your sexual activity, without any other preliminary foreplay. <br> <br><b>Second Variation</b> <br>In the middle of sexual relations--whether or not you have reached orgasm--when the jade stalk is still within the jade garden, stop all movement, carefully place yourselves in the position of this mudra, and practice it as described above. <br> <br>Then slowly resume your sexual activity, with the fire newly refueled. <br> <br><b>Third Variation</b> <br>Though it is rare, it may happen that after the sexual act the partners cannot stand to remain in contact, or even talk with each other. If this is the case, you can practice this exercise in order to try to reverse this tendency. <br> <br><b>Important</b> <br>This third variation should be practiced with the three points of contact reversed: kiss each other at the beginning of the mudra, then gently rub noses, then remain still, staring into each other&#x2019;s eyes before closing them and enjoying the serenity of this marvelous embrace. By prolonging this period of stillness, you can discover the different forms of energy that circulate within and between you. Once you are accustomed to this exercise, you will find that it brings great pleasure. <br> <br><b>33 <br>Ear Mudra <br></b> <br>This highly important zone is broadly connected to the kidneys, and more specifically to the spinal column, all along the outer edge of the auricle, from the lobe, which represents the head, to the top of the ear, which represents the sacral vertebrae, buttocks, and legs. <br> <br>According to the principles of auricular therapy, massaging the entire ear will tone not only the kidneys--the organs connected to sexuality and libidinal energy--but also all the reflexive zones of the body, corresponding to all the organs that are linked by nerves to that tree of life which is the spinal column. <br> <br>It should also be noted that the auricle is so sensitive that for most people it is an erogenous zone. Dormant sensations can be awakened simply by touching the ear gently, or lightly sucking on it. <br> <br><b>Exercise</b> <br>- Very simply, knead, caress, rub, gently pinch, and massage the ears. You can practice this mudra on one ear at a time or on both at once, depending on your preference. <br> <br>- This mudra, of course, can be practiced solo or with a partner, either taking turns or simultaneously.</p><h2>Learn How To Do Hand Sewing Stitches: Plus 20 Projects To Practice Your Skills</h2><p>Hand stitching is the basis for many sewing and craft projects.

Boris really wants a komodo dragon. He writes to the zoo to see if their komodo dragons ever take vacations. Turns out, they don't, and Boris's plans are ruined. He puts his skink in the komodo cage and tries to pass it off as a baby dragon. After it escapes, Boris reopens his letter from the zoo, finds tickets for free admission, and his whole family has an outing. Missy wants to take home the class pets for the weekend but her plans are derailed when a new girl is determined to have what she wants. In the end, Missy bests the bully. Boris's and Missy's stories are told through traditional text, many speech bubbles, and comic-book panels. Both books incorporate full-color artwork throughout. Meltodown Madness looks the most like a traditional early chapter book, with many black-and-white sketches accompanying the text. The young narrator has a magic coin that translates his words into reality (sayings like &#x201c;money doesn't grow on trees&#x201d; spawn a dollar bill under the tree). The boy's powers often cause more trouble than good, but in the end he is able to reason his way into a solution. Coco is in the form of a diary and includes black-and-white lists and doodles. The little girl uses her love of baking cupcakes to help save snails from becoming extinct. Words like &#x201c;extinct&#x201d; and &#x201c;fund-raiser&#x201d; are defined in doodled bubbles.

Despite Tacitus's claim that they were written objectively, the <i>Annals</i> is sharply critical of the emperors' excesses and fearful for the future of imperial Rome, while also filled with a longing for its past glories.<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

He enjoyed success as a both a politician and writer, publishing the Agricola (a biography of his father-in-law) and the Germania (an ethnographical study of the peoples of Germany) in 98. Today he is best known as a historian, the author of The Histories and the Annals. The culmination of Tacitus' public career was when he won the prestigious post of proconsul of Asia (112/13). He died at some point after 115 and probably lived into the reign of Hadrian, but there is no evidence for his later life or the date of his death. <br><br><b>Cynthia Damon</b> received her PhD from Stanford University and taught at Harvard University and at Amherst College before moving to the University of Pennsylvania.

He spent whole nights in prayer, reciting one or two passages from these luminaries and begging these saints to enlighten his understanding. Father Matta discloses: Whenever physical hunger turned cruel against me, I found my gratification in prayer. Whenever the biting cold of winter was unkind to me, I found my warmth in prayer. Whenever people were harsh to me (and their harshness was severe indeed) I found my comfort in prayer.

Her novel <em>The Round House</em> won the National Book Award for Fiction. <em>The Plague of Doves</em> won the Anisfield-Wolf Book Award and was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize, and her debut novel, <em>Love Medicine</em>, was the winner of the National Book Critics Circle Award. Erdrich has received the Library of Congress Prize in American Fiction, the prestigious PEN/Saul Bellow Award for Achievement in American Fiction, and the Dayton Literary Peace Prize. She lives in Minnesota with her daughters and is the owner of Birchbark Books, a small independent bookstore.</p>From The Washington Post's Book World/washingtonpost.com Reviewed by Valerie Sayers It has been 25 years since Louise Erdrich published the first of her vibrant novels -- or was that really a novel in the first place? Love Medicine, set on a Chippewa reservation in North Dakota, was told from a number of perspectives over many years, and some critics argued at the time that it was more properly described as a collection of stories. But Erdrich's use of multiple narrative voices has been, from the beginning, a fruitful choice. Besides, she hardly invented the concept of multiple narrative voices; her literary kinship with Faulkner in particular is apparent. Erdrich -- of mixed ancestry including German, Chippewa and French forebears -- has over the years created a Midwestern territory situated somewhere between the borders of realism and fanciful mythopoeticism. Hers is a place where Native and immigrant Americans live in uneasy proximity, where a single voice or angle of vision can't begin to reconstruct the whole tale, where characters make cameo appearances in multiple novels rather than play the starring role. You can call her slicing up of the story "postmodern" -- many have -- but Erdrich is a true original, and labels won't do justice to the oddness, wit and ferocity of her fiction. Now she has gathered a few new stories and many previously published as chapters in novels into a single volume that makes her work seem more modular than ever. Most of the pieces in The Red Convertible stand perfectly well on their own and resonate, in this arrangement, in new ways. If multiple voices seemed particularly apt 25 years ago, the recycling here is downright inspired. Short stories have a special punch, and though this is a long collection, many of these stories have that power. Erdrich's North Dakota and Minnesota settings, on and off the reservation, yield rich anthropological and political themes (the first story, "The Red Convertible," concerns a young Indian back from Vietnam). The myths and traditions of a people, whether Chippewa or German, inform the rich cadences of her storytelling. Short stories also enable her to concentrate on individuals and the singular pain that comes from poverty or alcoholism or sexual despair. Humiliation is a recurrent theme, but so is pride: Margaret Kashpaw, as punishment for her opposition to a treaty settlement, is attacked and shaved bald. But Margaret flaunts her baldness, just as Ojibwe men "press a sharp crease down the front of their blue jeans" to show that "although the government has tried in every way possible to destroy their manhood, they are undefeatable." One of the qualities that have made Erdrich's writing so attractive is the strutting sureness of her formulations -- "Owehzhee. We still look good and we know it" -- and another is her humor, dry and wry in equal measure. That humor is often aimed at two sensitive subjects: Christianity and sexuality. Religion is treated as, alternately, a consoling tradition and a construct designed for whites to wield power. One of Erdrich's most appalling, fascinating and funny creations is Sister Leopolda of "Saint Marie" (though she recurs in the novels, readers of these stories will get one good strong dose of her). Another is Father Damien, whose evolution as both religious and sexually ambiguous character is hinted at here. Indeed, sexuality and gender roles among both whites and Indians have always been key themes for Erdrich. Women often act outside their assigned roles, but here -- especially in the later stories -- men take on strange duties, none more so than the suckling of a baby girl accomplished by a runaway soldier in "Father's Milk." The later stories (and the novels in which they appear) explore sexuality in broadly humorous ways: The love struggles between the aging Margaret and Nanapush in "Le Mooz" are pathetic, touching, funny, even thrilling. Although despair, death and suicide take their toll again and again, these stories focus on the dignity that can accompany struggle, on the human capacity to embrace and forgive. Chippewa women often embody this graciousness, but white women too can exude wisdom: No woman is more dignified than the dying Eva, of "The Butcher's Wife." Erdrich doesn't flinch when she eyes the trials of motherhood, and some of the last stories pay special tribute to the mothers of middle-aged women. Erdrich has revisited her fiction before -- she revised and published a new edition of Love Medicine in 1993 -- a habit that points out her kinship to Faulkner in yet another way. Whether the decision to gather these stories was commercial, literary or both, I'm glad she's done it, even if not all of them are entirely successful in this context. "The Blue Velvet Box," which was published as a story before it made its appearance in the novel "The Beet Queen," is as powerful as ever, but seems here more of an introduction than a world unto itself. Midway through the collection, stories like "The Crest," are clever conceptually but written from an emotional distance unusual for Erdrich. The wonder, of course, is that so many of these pieces could be quilted together in the first place, much less ripped apart and re-stitched to such strong effect. Erdrich is one of our major writers: She illuminates large swaths of U.S. history and culture, and this volume is a good demonstration of her compelling stylistic innovations, not to mention her literary cunning. <br>Copyright 2009, The Washington Post.

This landmark volume is a guide for clinicians to effectively deliver evidence-based rehabilitation interventions in everyday clinical practice. Never before has research outcomes been made so accessible for use in everyday clinical work. This vital volume raises the bar in cognitive rehabilitation by aiding clinicians in delivering high-quality, empirically-supported interventions to improve the lives of patients. Based on the series of evidence-based reviews of the scientific literature in cognitive rehabilitation conducted by Keith Cicerone, PhD, ABPP-Cn and colleagues, and published in the Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, these evidence-based reviews identify high-quality research studies that support the use of rehabilitation interventions in a number of cognitive domains including attention, memory, language, visuospatial abilities, social-communication skills and metacognitive functions. The Cognitive Rehabilitation Manual fills provides step-by-step instructions for the interventions recommended. This Manual is an essential tool for any rehabilitation professional who regularly provides cognitive rehabilitation services. The Manual is ideally suited for clinicians who have had some formal training in cognitive rehabilitation, and who have experience working with individuals with brain injury (e.g., traumatic brain injury, stroke). The interventions described can be readily used by occupational therapists, speech and language therapists, psychologists, and other rehabilitation professionals. The Cognitive Rehabilitation Manual; Translating Evidence-Based Recommendations into Practice was created by the Brain Injury Interdisciplinary Special Interest Group (BI-ISIG) of the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine (ACRM) is committed to fostering the use of empirically supported interventions to improve the lives of individuals with brain injury. A series of reviews, which are published in the Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (Cicerone et al., 2000; 2005; 2011) have reviewed the scientific literature and put forth standards and guidelines for clinical practice based on the quality of evidence available for each intervention. The Cognitive Rehabilitation Manual operationalizes or &#x201c;translates&#x201d; these guidelines into step-by-step procedures that can be used by clinicians who treat individuals with brain injury. The volume is organized into six chapters. The introductory chapter compiles the clinical wisdom of the authors into a practical roadmap for structuring and implementing cognitive rehabilitation interventions. Treatment considerations and patient factors that may influence the course of treatment are discussed, and a guide to goal-setting that is applied throughout the manual is introduced. Subsequent chapters present practical guides for the implementation of evidence-based interventions for impairments in each of the following areas: Executive Functions, Memory, Attention, Hemispatial Neglect, and Social Communication. The content of each chapter draws from empirically-supported rehabilitation interventions included in the Cicerone et al. reviews (2000; 2005; 2011) and the collective clinical experience of the authors of the Cognitive Rehabilitation Manual. Wherever possible, step-by-step guidelines for implementing each intervention and setting relevant individual goals are provided, along with clinical recommendations for tailoring and modifying the intervention according to patients&#x2019; needs. In cases where in-depth treatment manuals exist, full references and links to these materials are provided. Additional appendices include rubrics for goal-setting in each of these domains of functioning, and handouts or worksheets that can be used to record and evaluate progress.</p><p>Edward C.

Even so, many people remain confused about what, exactly, politicians and media persons mean when they discuss inequality. What does "economic inequality" mean? How is it measured? Why should we care? Why did inequality rise in the United States? Is rising inequality an inevitable feature of capitalism? What should we do about it? <br><br><em>Inequality: What Everyone Needs to Know</em> takes up these questions and more in plain and clear language, bringing to life one of the great economic and political debates of our age. Inequality expert James K. Galbraith has compiled the latest economic research on inequality and explains his findings in a way that everyone can understand. He offers a comprehensive introduction to the study of economic inequality, including its philosophical and theoretical origins, the variety of concepts in wide use, empirical measures and their advantages and disadvantages, competing modern theories of the causes and effects of rising inequality in the United States and worldwide, and a range of policy measures.<br><br>The topic of economic inequality is going to become only more important as we approach the 2016 presidential elections.

In this book, Kenneth Judd presents techniques from the numerical analysis and applied mathematics literatures and shows how to use them in economic analyses. The book is divided into five parts. Part I provides a general introduction. Part II presents basics from numerical analysis on R^n, including linear equations, iterative methods, optimization, nonlinear equations, approximation methods, numerical integration and differentiation, and Monte Carlo methods. Part III covers methods for dynamic problems, including finite difference methods, projection methods, and numerical dynamic programming. Part IV covers perturbation and asymptotic solution methods. Finally, Part V covers applications to dynamic equilibrium analysis, including solution methods for perfect foresight models and rational expectation models.

This volume combines both disciplines for a philosophical interpretation of quantum physics &#x2014; an interpretation free from the imprecision of metaphysics, offering a view of the atomic world and its quantum mechanical results as concrete as the visible everyday world.<br>Written by an internationally renowned philosopher who specialized in symbolic logic and the theory of relativity, this approach consists of three parts. The first section, which requires no background in math or physics, reviews the basics of quantum mechanics, outlining their philosophical interpretation and summarizing their results. The second part, which presupposes a knowledge of calculus, outlines the mathematical methods of quantum mechanics; and the third part blends the philosophical ideas of the first part and the mathematical formulations of the second part <i>to </i>develop a variety of interpretations of quantum mechanics. The author presents in-depth discussions of each interpretation, constructing a conclusion in terms of three-valued logic that offers readers a satisfactory logical form of quantum mechanics.<br>Focusing on clarification of concepts rather than developing problem-solving skills, this volume will prove enlightening <i>to </i>students of mathematics, physics, and the other sciences.</p><p></p></p><p></p><h2>The Psychology of Computer Programming: Silver Anniversary Edition</h2><p>This landmark 1971 classic is reprinted with a new preface, chapter-by-chapter commentary, and straight-from-the-heart observations on topics that affect the professional life of programmers.<br><br>Long regarded as one of the first books to pioneer a people-oriented approach to computing, The Psychology of Computer Programming endures as a penetrating analysis of the intelligence, skill, teamwork, and problem-solving power of the computer programmer.<br><br>Finding the chapters strikingly relevant to today's issues in programming, Gerald M.

They offer an urgent guide to Stoic self-improvement but also cast light on Roman attitudes towards slavery, gladiatorial combat and suicide. This selection of letters conveys their range and variety, with a particular focus on letters from the earlier part of the collection. As well as a general introduction, it features a brief introductory essay on each letter, which draws out its themes and sets it in context. The commentary explains the more challenging aspects of Seneca&#39;s Latin. It also casts light on his engagement with Stoic (and Epicurean) ideas, on the historical context within which the letters were written and on their literary sophistication. This edition will be invaluable for undergraduate and graduate students and scholars of Seneca&#39;s moral and intellectual development.</p><p>The letters of Seneca are uniquely engaging; they offer an urgent guide to Stoic self-improvement but also cast light on Roman attitudes towards slavery, gladiatorial combat and suicide.

This book deals with decision modelling techniques that can be used to estimate the value for money of various interventions including medical devices, surgical procedures, diagnostic technologies, and pharmaceuticals. Particular emphasis is placed on the importance of the appropriate representation of uncertainty in the evaluative process and the implication this uncertainty has for decision making and the need for future research. This highly practical guide takes the reader through the key principles and approaches of modelling techniques. It begins with the basics of constructing different forms of the model, the population of the model with input parameter estimates, analysis of the results, and progression to the holistic view of models as a valuable tool for informing future research exercises. Case studies and exercises are supported with online templates and solutions. This book will help analysts understand the contribution of decision-analytic modelling to the evaluation of health care programmes. ABOUT THE SERIES: Economic evaluation of health interventions is a growing specialist field, and this series of practical handbooks will tackle, in-depth, topics superficially addressed in more general health economics books. Each volume will include illustrative material, case histories and worked examples to encourage the reader to apply the methods discussed, with supporting material provided online. This series is aimed at health economists in academia, the pharmaceutical industry and the health sector, those on advanced health economics courses, and health researchers in associated fields.</p><p><br>Andrew Briggs was appointed to the Lindsay Chair in Health Policy and Economic Evaluation in June 2005.

Far from being 'silent witnesses to the passage of time', plants are dynamic components of our world, shaping the environment throughout history as much as that environment has shaped them.<br><br>In <em>The Emerald Planet</em>, David Beerling puts plants centre stage, revealing the crucial role they have played in driving global changes in the environment, in recording hidden facets of Earth's history, and in helping us to predict its future. His account draws together evidence from fossil plants, from experiments with their living counterparts, and from computer models of the 'Earth System', to illuminate the history of our planet and its biodiversity. This new approach reveals how plummeting carbon dioxide levels removed a barrier to the evolution of the leaf; how plants played a starring role in pushing oxygen levels upwards, allowing spectacular giant insects to thrive in the Carboniferous; and it strengthens fascinating and contentious fossil evidence for an ancient hole in the ozone layer. Along the way, Beerling introduces a lively cast of pioneering scientists from Victorian times onwards whose discoveries provided the crucial background to these and the other puzzles.<br><br>This understanding of our planet's past sheds a sobering light on our own climate-changing activities, and offers clues to what our climatic and ecological futures might look like.

How rapidly descending,<br>Falls the avalanche of fate!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;Tobia Gorrio, <i>La Gioconda</i></p><p>ONE</p><p>February 1932, Phipps Psychiatric Clinic</p><p>Johns Hopkins University Hospital, Baltimore, Maryland</p><p>The ward was never the same after that February afternoon when Zelda Fitzgerald stumbled into the psychiatric clinic with a stack of papers clutched to her chest, eyes darting this way and that, at once pushing from and pulling toward her husband like a spinning magnet.</p><p>I opened my arms to her. She would not look at me, her nurse, or allow me to touch her, but walked next to me down the hallway to her room. We left Mr. Fitzgerald at the desk preparing to meet with the resident in charge of his wife&#x2019;s case, when Mrs. Fitzgerald suddenly stopped and ran back to him, nearly knocking him over with her force. Her husband wrapped his arms around her and kissed her hair with an intensity that filled me with longing and squeezed my heart. They both began to cry like two lost, scared children. They were not what I expected in any way.</p><p>As quickly as she&#x2019;d run to him, she pulled herself out of his arms and came back to me. It was then that I met his gaze&#x2014;ice-green eyes underlined by dark circles, his hair and clothing a rumpled mess. I was overtaken by a sense of pity for the two of them and thought that he too might benefit from a stay with us.</p><p>&#x201c;On my left, my left,&#x201d; said Mrs. Fitzgerald.</p><p>&#x201c;Pardon me?&#x201d; I asked her.</p><p>&#x201c;You must walk on my left. I can&#x2019;t see out of the right eye.&#x201d;</p><p>I knew the doctor&#x2019;s notes said she claimed to have blindness in her right eye, so I obeyed her wishes as we walked down the hall. I noticed a red rash creeping up her neck that she scratched with her jagged nails. By the time we reached the room, she&#x2019;d succeeded in making her neck bleed.</p><p>As soon as we arrived, she collapsed onto the bed, still clutching her papers as if they were a precious infant. She cried in a low moan. An orderly carried in her bags and placed them on the shiny floor next to the door.</p><p>&#x201c;Mrs. Fitzgerald, I&#x2019;ll need to look you over for admission,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Is it okay with you if I take your blood pressure and listen to your heart?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;My heart,&#x201d; she whispered. &#x201c;My poor broken heart.&#x201d;</p><p>I walked to her and gently pulled her to a sitting position.</p><p>&#x201c;May I place your papers on the bedside table?&#x201d; I asked.</p><p>She looked at me with fear in her eyes, and then out the door.</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t show him. He can&#x2019;t see it,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>I wondered who she was afraid would see the papers. Was she referring to her husband? If so, why was she simultaneously distressed at being separated from him, but emphatic that he not see what she clutched in her hands?</p><p>&#x201c;If you&#x2019;d like to keep the papers with you,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;I can work around them.&#x201d;</p><p>She nodded with some reluctance and put the papers on her lap. I glanced down and saw pages of what must have been her handwriting, surprisingly straight but with the loops and embellishments of a young girl. I was curious about their contents but didn&#x2019;t want to press her, especially since she began to wheeze.</p><p>&#x201c;I have asthma,&#x201d; she said while she gasped.</p><p>There was a note in the file about asthma, but here, watching her, I thought it more likely that she had panic-induced breathlessness. Her heart rate was elevated and her blood pressure high.</p><p>&#x201c;There, there,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;You are in a state. Let&#x2019;s try to get you calm.&#x201d;</p><p>The place on her neck that she&#x2019;d scratched needed attention, so once she seemed more settled, I stepped away to fetch some antiseptic and a bandage. When I returned, she still sat on the bed, clutching her papers, crying out every now and then in anguish. I cleaned her wound, but she soon began to recoil from my touch and questions as if they were flames licking at her face.</p><p>I watched her eyes glass over and she entered into the catatonic state sometimes present with schizophrenic patients. She looked through me with her large gray eyes in the most unsettling way, and I had the distinct feeling of having encountered such eyes before, but could not place them. Her limbs were stiff, but I helped her to lie on the bed and moved the papers close to her heart. I covered her with a blanket, drew the curtains, and locked her in the room.</p><p>As I left her, dread pushed down through my shoulders and into my chest. It was as if someone closed a fist around my lungs, and sweat beaded along my brow. I stopped and leaned against the door to catch my breath, wondering whether I was suddenly becoming ill, when it hit me: Mrs. Fitzgerald&#x2019;s eyes were like my own, reflected in the mirror across from my bed years ago, after the war and my great losses.</p><p>Memories of my husband and daughter roared up like waves in my ears, along with the crippling sensation that accompanied the remembrance of their absence. I could not think of them here in this place, so I wished them away and they retreated.</p><p>Later. Later.</p><p>Mrs. Fitzgerald&#x2019;s eyes, however, would not leave my mind. I had no idea what those haunting eyes would lead me to do. If I&#x2019;d known then, I don&#x2019;t think I would have become as involved as I did.</p><p>No, I still would have.</p><p>Mr. Fitzgerald&#x2019;s strain was palpable in the room.</p><p>We sat near Dr. Meyer&#x2019;s desk in his warm study&#x2014;young resident Dr. Mildred Squires, Scott Fitzgerald, and I. We let Mr. Fitzgerald talk while we took notes, each of us judging him in spite of ourselves, and trying to understand his broken wife.</p><p>It was clear that Mr. Fitzgerald was near a breaking point himself. His hands shook and he chain-smoked. He often stood to pace the room while he gathered his thoughts. Then he would sit abruptly, cough, and continue. I listened to him with great interest, for he spoke like a storyteller.</p><p>&#x201c;She was born and raised a free and indulged child in Montgomery, Alabama,&#x201d; he began. &#x201c;Her mother allowed her at the breast until she was four years old and never told her no. Her father was a stoic and admired judge.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Was her relationship with her father difficult?&#x201d; asked Dr. Meyer, a stern, spectacled German in charge of the Phipps Clinic.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, I&#x2019;d say so,&#x201d; said Mr. Fitzgerald. &#x201c;Judge Sayre was a practical sort of old Southern gentleman. He didn&#x2019;t understand his daughter.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But Mrs. Sayre did?&#x201d; asked Dr. Squires.</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think she understood Zelda, either,&#x201d; said Scott. &#x201c;She encouraged her, especially as a wild debutante.&#x201d;</p><p>He stood again, walked to the window, and lit a new cigarette. His nervous energy disturbed all of us. Out of the corner of my eye, I caught the usually steady and solid Dr. Meyer squirming in his chair.</p><p>&#x201c;Zelda is strong willed and stubborn. Hates taking instruction,&#x201d; continued Fitzgerald.</p><p>&#x201c;I know she was previously at Malmaison and Valmont clinics in Switzerland and diagnosed as schizophrenic,&#x201d; said Dr. Meyer. &#x201c;What precipitated her first collapse?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;There was a&#x201d;&#x2014;he faltered a moment&#x2014;&#x201c;relationship of mine with a young actress when we were in Hollywood in &#x2019;twenty-six or &#x2019;twenty-seven that affected her. Entirely chaste, mind you, but Zelda wouldn&#x2019;t hear otherwise. This was following a relationship Zelda had with a Frenchman. Then there was her suicidal practice of ballet. She&#x2019;d dance six, even eight hours a day until her feet bled and there were pools of sweat on the floor. That&#x2019;s the pattern, you know. She gets manic about some form of art, becomes closed off from me, aggravates her asthma and eczema, then breaks down.&#x201d;</p><p>I was fascinated by his justification of his affair and her behavior patterns. Was either of them unfaithful? Was Zelda punishing herself through art or trying to find herself? My thoughts again returned to the stack of papers she&#x2019;d guarded so closely.</p><p>&#x201c;What are the papers she brought?&#x201d; I asked.</p><p>His laugh was bitter. &#x201c;Her latest obsession: a novel. She thinks she will outdo me.&#x201d;</p><p>His pretension could not hide that he felt threatened by her. Did he wish to be the only one in their marriage with any accomplishment? Did he undermine her attempts at expression? Or perhaps she antagonized him.</p><p>&#x201c;Once she gets an idea in her head she won&#x2019;t change it for a stack of Lincolns,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Do you know she thinks I dallied with Ernest Hemingway?&#x201d;</p><p>We all looked up from our notepads.</p><p>&#x201c;I did not, of course, but she&#x2019;s convinced.&#x201d;</p><p>His weary tone caused me to believe him, though I wondered what made her make such an assumption. I began to pity him again.</p><p>He returned to his chair and asked for a glass of water. His skin was pale, and sweat formed along his upper lip. I poured him some water from a pitcher on Meyer&#x2019;s side table, and Fitzgerald met my eyes directly when he thanked me.</p><p>&#x201c;That is enough for today,&#x201d; said Dr. Meyer. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s clear that you both need rest. Will you be staying in Baltimore long?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, I&#x2019;ll return to Montgomery tomorrow. My daughter, Scottie, needs me. I don&#x2019;t want to uproot her again. Not yet, anyway.&#x201d;</p><p>I knew in some vague way that they h...</p></p><h2>Sunshine Beach (Ten Beach Road Series)</h2><p><b>In this brand-new summer read by the <i>USA Today</i> bestselling author of <i>The House on Mermaid Point</i>, three women join forces to bring a historic seaside hotel back to life...</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> <i>There&#x2019;s nothing that a fresh coat of paint and a few glasses of wine can&#x2019;t fix...</i><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br>After losing their life savings in a Ponzi scheme, Maddie, Avery, and Nikki have banded together to make the most of what they have left, using their determination, ingenuity, guts, and a large dose of elbow grease.

Which might be why she felt like Cinderella that May evening as William Hightower handed her out of his boat and onto the dock at the Lorelei Restaurant and Cabana Bar. If, that was, Cinderella had to color her hair, suck in her stomach, and wore a size too large to make America&#x2019;s Next Top Model.</p><p>Perched on the edge of U.S. 1, the multitiered Islamorada landmark served good, basic food, poured potent drinks, and drew a mostly laid-back crowd for its nightly sunset celebrations. Tables surrounded a thatched hut of a stage and spilled out onto a half-moon of beach where you could eat with your bare feet buried in the sand and your eyes pinned to a truly spectacular sunset that played out over the Florida Bay.</p><p>Remnants of sunlight glinted off the black hair lightly threaded with gray that brushed William&#x2019;s shoulders and cast his sharply angled face into shadow. &#x201c;Should be interesting to see what kind of reaction we get to the new song,&#x201d; he said as he retrieved his guitar case from the boat and slipped an arm around her shoulders.</p><p>&#x201c;Everybody on Mermaid Point loved it,&#x201d; she reminded him. &#x201c;You got a standing ovation.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah, well, let&#x2019;s not forget Mermaid Point is surrounded by water. The residents are a captive audience.&#x201d;</p><p>Maddie laughed but did not concede the point. She may not be a musician, but she knew a great song when she heard one. Will had written &#x201c;Free Fall&#x201d; in September not long after she and the rest of the Do Over crew had finished turning William Hightower&#x2019;s private island into what was supposed to have been a high-end bed-and-breakfast but which he&#x2019;d turned into a sober living facility. It was the first song he&#x2019;d written after more than a decade unable to make music at all. The first he&#x2019;d ever written without the benefit of drugs or alcohol.</p><p>&#x201c;And not that I don&#x2019;t appreciate it,&#x201d; he added. &#x201c;But I don&#x2019;t think you&#x2019;re completely objective.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;True,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;But I was a William Hightower fan way before I ever met you.&#x201d; That had been back when he was building a name as a southern rocker, and Wasted Indian had been climbing to the top of the charts. &#x201c;So let&#x2019;s not go questioning my musical taste.&#x201d;</p><p>His dark eyes creased with amusement. The spider&#x2019;s web of lines at their corners attested to all he&#x2019;d been through. He dropped a kiss on the top of her head, then headed for the stage.</p><p>Maddie leaned against a vacant post not far from the bar that afforded an unobstructed view over the already packed tables that fanned out from the stage. A waitress handed her a glass of Pinot Noir, which she accepted gladly. She sipped it as Will and the musicians he&#x2019;d cobbled together set up. Her eyes scanned the stage, the crowd, and the sun that hung in midair poised for its swan dive into the bay. She had only one more day with Will before she&#x2019;d drive up to Bella Flora, the house that she, Nicole Grant, and Avery Lawford had nursed back to life and which had now become home. There they&#x2019;d have to figure out what, if anything, they could do about the show they&#x2019;d created, lost control of, and then quit so publicly.</p><p>Conversation ceased as William stepped up to the microphone. All eyes, including hers, fastened on the man who had once hung in poster form on her bedroom wall. William Hightower might be sixty-two, but he&#x2019;d come out of rehab a little over a year ago for what he&#x2019;d vowed would be the last time, looking hot as hell.</p><p>With a salt breeze and a pinkening sky for background, Will laid out his losses with a pain-roughened voice. He&#x2019;d lost his younger brother and the woman who&#x2019;d borne his son to drugs and excess. The pain had only mounted as he disappeared into every vial and bottle he could find in an attempt to hide from the hurt. Tonight he hid nothing, singing with his eyes closed, his fingers lithe on his guitar strings, his body taut with emotion. The crowd&#x2019;s response was equally visceral. When he finished, Maddie&#x2019;s were not the only cheeks wet with tears. She&#x2019;d expected that. What she hadn&#x2019;t anticipated was the naked hunger that shone in the eyes of his female fans.</p><p>He sent her a smile over the heads of the women who mobbed him after the set, and she managed to smile back even as she struggled to tamp down her jealousy and uncertainty.</p><p>She&#x2019;d learned over the last months to stop apologizing for her body or even trying to hide it from him, though the stomach sucking was a reflex with a mind of its own. He insisted he wasn&#x2019;t comparing her to anyone; that she, a fifty-one-year-old mother of two and grandmother of one, turned him on just the way she was.</p><p>But if Will&#x2019;s mind didn&#x2019;t stray to all the women who&#x2019;d come before her or to the tsunami of female adoration that was currently washing over him, Maddie&#x2019;s did. A lifetime spent as a suburban housewife prepared a woman for a lot of things. A relationship with a man like William Hightower wasn&#x2019;t one of them.</p><p>&#x201c;You were fabulous,&#x201d; she said on the boat ride back to Mermaid Point. &#x201c;Could you feel how the audience reacted to &#x2018;Free Fall&#x2019;? God, they loved it. They were hanging on every word.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah.&#x201d; Steering with his right hand, he pulled her onto his lap with his left. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t expect to get the same high, you know, performing straight. But it&#x2019;s a definite rush. Kind of like a shot of adrenaline to the heart.&#x201d;</p><p>His body was hard and warm against hers. She could practically feel that adrenaline coursing through him. When they reached the house, Will emptied his pockets onto the bedroom dresser and began to shuck his clothes.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m way too wired to go to bed,&#x201d; he said pulling on swim trunks. &#x201c;Want to come for a swim?&#x201d;</p><p>She&#x2019;d become used to taking off her clothes in front of him, had been unable to argue his unfailingly positive physical reaction to her, but his reception tonight had proved that while she might have tamped down her insecurities, she hadn&#x2019;t shed them completely.</p><p>&#x201c;I think I&#x2019;ll stay here and start getting my things together.&#x201d; Unable to meet his eyes, she glanced at the items he&#x2019;d pulled from his pockets. There were two cocktail napkins with names and phone numbers, one of them written in bright red lipstick. A crumbled photo of&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. &#x201c;Is that a naked woman?&#x201d; She moved toward the dresser for a closer look. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t know anyone owned a Polaroid camera any more.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hmmm?&#x201d; Will asked as he reached for a towel.</p><p>&#x201c;This.&#x201d; She held the photo up by one corner. &#x201c;This naked photo.&#x201d;</p><p>He turned to look at the photo Maddie held between her fingertips. He snorted. &#x201c;Given who I think shoved that in my pocket, I doubt it&#x2019;s remotely recent.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Someone shoved a naked photo of herself in your pocket,&#x201d; she repeated dully.</p><p>&#x201c;Um-hm.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And this is&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ?&#x201d; She scooped up a wisp of red lace, dropping it when she realized what it was. &#x201c;A thong.&#x201d; She could hear the note of disbelief in her voice.</p><p>&#x201c;Seems to be.&#x201d; Will shrugged and smiled. &#x201c;You sure you don&#x2019;t want to come for a swim? It&#x2019;s past resident curfew. We&#x2019;d have the pool and the hot tub to ourselves.&#x201d; He shot her a wink.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m looking at a thong that a complete stranger placed in your pocket.&#x201d; A thong that she doubted would make it over one of her thighs. &#x201c;And all you&#x2019;re thinking about is going for a swim. With me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Absolutely.&#x201d; He leaned down and brushed his lips across hers. &#x201c;What else should I be thinking about?&#x201d; He asked this as if every female at the Lorelei that night hadn&#x2019;t spent the evening mentally undressing him and would gladly swim naked to Mermaid Point, like some Sexual Seal Team Six, if invited.</p><p>Maddie hadn&#x2019;t dated in close to thirty years and she&#x2019;d never dated a rock star, but she was pretty certain that freaking out over groupies or calling attention to all the women William could have sex with instead of her was not a good idea. She shrugged as casually as she could. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know. I&#x2019;ve never been in this situation before.&#x201d; She looked at but did not touch the thong.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s nothing,&#x201d; he said tucking the towel under one arm. He hadn&#x2019;t bothered to put on a shirt and she couldn&#x2019;t help watching the play of muscle as he shrugged again. &#x201c;It just goes with the territory. You walk up on a stage and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. seriously, Maddie, there&#x2019;s no accounting for what some people will do or assume.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Right.&#x201d;</p><p>His eyes held hers, but he didn&#x2019;t argue the point. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m just going to do a few laps. I&#x2019;ll be back in a bit.&#x201d;</p><p>Maddie knew him well enough to know that a few laps could be anywhere from fifty to infinity. Swimming had been his go-to stress reliever during and after rehab, and he typically swam twice a day out of habit, she thought, as much as necessity. She stood out on the balcony and watched him slip into the pool; it and the ocean beyond glimmered in the moonlight. Only a few years ago she&#x2019;d dreamt of empty nesting only to have that nest filled with an aging mother-in-law, an unexpectedly pregnant daughter, and an unemployed husband who&#x2019;d lost everything, including his job, to Malcolm Dyer&#x2019;s Ponzi scheme. Two desperate years of hanging on and staying afloat had followed. Now here she stood on the bedroom balcony of William Hightower&#x2019;s private island, an outcome she&#x2019;d never imagined in her wildest dreams.</p><p>Inside she began to empty her drawers, carefully avoiding the items that still littered Will&#x2019;s dresser. Then she got undressed, slid into bed, and lay listening to the rhythmic splash of his flutter kick. Somewhere in the middle of lap thirty-five she finally fell asleep.</p><p></p><br><p>Two</p><p>Avery Lawford pushed a stray curl off her forehead. Eyes half closed she stumbled toward the kitchen relying on her nose to lead her toward the all-important coffeepot.</p><p>&#x201c;Here you go.&#x201d; A mug of coffee, warm and wondrous, was placed in her hands.</p><p>She breathed in its dark, delicious aroma, then took a first sip. Her eyes opened another notch as she moaned with pleasure. &#x201c;You are a fine human being.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And a careful one,&#x201d; Chase Hardin said as she took another sip. &#x201c;I know how to read warning labels.&#x201d; His finger skimmed across the T-shirt she&#x2019;d slept in. A gift from Kyra Singer, who knew her well, and that read, I Drink Coffee for Your Protection.</p><p>She could feel his eyes on her as she took another sip. She sighed with pleasure as the liquid caffeine began to rouse and warm her.</p><p>&#x201c;Okay, guys, I think it&#x2019;s safe to go about your business now,&#x201d; Chase said.</p><p>A utensil clattered against a hard surface. The refrigerator door opened. After an especially heavenly sip she opened her eyes all the way and took in the kitchen. Which looked as if a hurricane had swept through it. Chase&#x2019;s father Jeff sat at the kitchen table, his walker beside him, the morning paper folded to the sports page. Chase&#x2019;s son Josh was in the process of wolfing down a bowl of cereal while his brother Jason helped himself to eggs from a pan on the stove.</p><p>Muzzy with sleep Avery blinked away a vision of Deirdre Morgan, the mother who&#x2019;d abandoned her for decades and then reappeared without warning, standing at that very stove demonstrating her newly acquired culinary skills.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to drop the guys at school, then take Dad to his doctor&#x2019;s appointment. If he&#x2019;s got the energy I&#x2019;ll take him to the job site with me.&#x201d; Chase now ran what had once been their fathers&#x2019; construction business. Avery had been working with him since she&#x2019;d come back from Mermaid Point. Where the mother she&#x2019;d only just forgiven for abandoning her had crumpled at her feet and died of a brain aneurysm. Avery looked down into the swirl of creamed coffee, blinking away tears as she tried to dislodge the image. Her hand shook as she raised the cup to her lips.</p><p>&#x201c;If the day ever comes that I&#x2019;d rather sit at home like an old fart than visit one of our construction sites, I&#x2019;ll let you know,&#x201d; Jeff snapped.</p><p>Chase nodded to his father but made no comment. Pulling a crumpled bakery bag from the back of a cabinet, he carried it to the table. &#x201c;I managed to save you exactly one glazed donut,&#x201d; he said as he placed the bag in front of Avery. &#x201c;Next time you&#x2019;re going to have to hide them better.&#x201d;</p><p>She extracted the donut from the bag and pinched off a bite knowing as she began to chew the sugary confection that if Deirdre were there, she&#x2019;d be lobbying for Avery to trade the donut for a fat-free yogurt.</p><p>&#x201c;Have you guys got your lunches packed?&#x201d; Chase asked. He was running full throttle while she was still trying to get up to speed.</p><p>Mouths full, both boys grunted in the affirmative.</p><p>&#x201c;Is there anything I&#x2019;m supposed to sign, deliver, or do that I don&#x2019;t already know about?&#x201d; Chase, who had a lot of years as a single father under his belt, prodded.</p><p>They shook their heads.</p><p>&#x201c;Are you sure?&#x201d;</p><p>There were two identical eye rolls. The chewing didn&#x2019;t stop.</p><p>&#x201c;What do you have going on today?&#x201d; Chase asked Avery.</p><p>&#x201c;Hmmm?&#x201d; She downed the last of her coffee, managed another bite of the donut, and blinked up at him. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to finish those sketches for the O&#x2019;Reilly addition. And I had some ideas for the spec home on Davis Island.&#x201d; She enjoyed being a part of the company their fathers had built. Being busy helped, but it hadn&#x2019;t eliminated the aching sense of loss she still felt for the mother she&#x2019;d lived so much of her life without. Nor did it erase her worry over whether Do Over could be salvaged. And if they did salvage the show? What would it be without Deirdre, who&#x2019;d put her personal stamp on every property they&#x2019;d touched?</p><p>&#x201c;Do you have time to help me pick up the boys&#x2019; Explorer from the repair shop later?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Um, sure.&#x201d; She took another sip of coffee, willing the caffeine into her bloodstream, and her thoughts back to the present. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m wide open today. Tomorrow I&#x2019;m going to Bella Flora&#x2014;Maddie and Nikki should be there in time for dinner. I thought I&#x2019;d stay there at least through the weekend. We&#x2019;ve got to figure out our next moves.&#x201d; She swallowed. Deirdre&#x2019;s absence would be even more palpable when they were all under one roof again. Especially Bella Flora&#x2019;s.</p><p>&#x201c;Are you okay?&#x201d; Chase asked quietly as he took her empty cup and carried it to the coffeepot to refill it.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; she said automatically. &#x201c;Thanks. I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; Her voice trailed off as she accepted the coffee, cupping the warm mug between both hands.</p><p>She was once again blinking back tears as the boys put their empty bowls in the sink. Chase took his father&#x2019;s plate, added it to the stack, and reached to open the dishwasher.</p><p>Avery waved him away. &#x201c;Go ahead. You&#x2019;ll be late. I can load the dishwasher.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thanks,&#x201d; he said pecking her on the cheek. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll text you when the Explorer is ready.&#x201d;</p><p>At her nod he shooed the boys out the door, then hovered at his father&#x2019;s side as Jeff maneuvered the walker through the kitchen. A few minutes later the garage door rumbled shut.</p><p>She was sorry to see them go. Sorrier still when the quiet that she would have once treasured, descended. Alone was not good. Alone in the silence was even worse.</p><p>&#x201c;Get over yourself,&#x201d; she muttered as she stood and carried her coffee cup to the sink.

For many of these establishments, the photographs mark the end of a legacy. In the wake of gentrification, vital facets of New York's cultural heritage are disappearing at an alarming rate. Store Front (Mini) immerses the reader in a virtual tour of NYC at its most authentic. From tiny stores tucked away on narrow side streets to well-known institutions on historic avenues, this book presents the individual images and shop owner stories that together make up a collective history. Up until now, there has been little attention paid to New York's storefronts; this book reverses that glaring omission and makes clear that the spirit of New York City is etched in its facades.<br><br> The influx of big box retailers and chain stores pose a serious threat to these humble institutions, and neighborhood modernization and the anonymity it brings are replacing the unique appearance and character of what were once incredibly colorful streets. Store Front is a visual guide to New York City's timeworn storefronts, a collection of powerful images that capture the neighborhood spirit, familiarity, comfort and warmth that these shops once embodied.</p><p>"One of the period's most successful New York books- an evergreen subgenre- STORE FRONT demonstrated the paradoxical power of digital photo editing to alter actual views in order for us to see more clearly what is actually there."<br><br><i>-Bookforum</i>James and Karla Murray have lectured extensively on the plight of New York City&#39;s mom and pop stores at venues including The New York Public Library, The Brooklyn Historical Society, The Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation and the Lower East Side Tenement Museum.

Del Castillo saw Cort�s sink his own ships (to prevent desertion) as soon as they landed on Mexican soil, and watched Montezuma become a prisoner in his own palace. The immediacy of his voice as translated by renowned scholar A.P. Maudslay reaches across the centuries to invite readers to witness for themselves the horrors and wonders of the initial, apocalyptic clash between two great civilizations.</p><p><b>Bernal Diaz del Castillo</b> fought in over one hundred battles against Mexico.

The results can be sexy or serious, satirical or tender, discreetly coded or defiantly outspoken. This beautiful book illustrates the wide variety of queer art from around the world exploring bodies and identity, love and desire, and prejudice and protest through drawing, painting, photography, sculpture, and installation. Seventy outstanding works from 1900 to the present reveal how queer experiences have differed across time and place, and how art has been part of a story of changing attitudes and emerging identities. Featuring works by, among others, Egon Schiele, Duncan Grant, Claude Cahun, Hannah H�ch, Frida Kahlo, David Hockney, Glenn Ligon, Zanele Muholi, Allyson Mitchell and Tomoko Kashiki, all of whom subverted the norms of their day via bold, new forms of expression, <i>A Queer Little History of Art</i> is a celebration of more than 100 years of queer creativity.<br> &nbsp;</p><p><b>Alex Pilcher</b> is a web developer at Tate with a background in art history, and is a member of Tate&#x2019;s LGBT network.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Hill William</h2><p><p>"You can tell McClanahan feels something when he writes and when he lives.

Lawrence Osborne comes for the cheap dentistry. Broke - but no longer in pain - he finds that he can live in Bangkok on a few dollars a day. Osborne&#39;s is a visceral experience of Bangkok, whether he&#39;s wandering the canals that fill the old city; dining at the No Hands Restaurant, where his waitress feeds him like a baby; or launching his own notably unsuccessful career as a gigolo. A guide without inhibitions, Osborne takes us to a feverish place where a strange blend of ancient Buddhist practice and new sexual mores has created a version of modernity only superficially indebted to the West. &#34;Bangkok Days&#34; is a love letter to the city that revived Osborne&#39;s faith in adventure and the world. &#39;Thailand inspires such enthralled romanticism that it also invites great cynicism and it is a feat to acknowledge all its complexities and graces, as Osborne does, without ever quite surrendering to them&#39; - Pico Iyer, &#34;Los Angeles Times&#34;.</p><p>Born in England, Lawrence Osborne is the author of the critically acclaimed novels The Forgiven, The Ballad of a Small Player, Hunters in the Dark and Beautiful Animals.

He lives in Bangkok.<b>Chapter One </b><p><b></b></p><b>&nbsp; </b><p><b></b></p><b>Wang Lang</b> <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>A few years ago I lived in a neighborhood called Wang Lang. From where I sit now, watching trains cross to Manhattan on the Brooklyn Bridge, my river balcony in Bangkok seems like a patch of paradise forever lost. Disassembled and stowed away in a hopeless corner of the mind, where it's bound to rot. At this very hour, when New York seems filled with threatening drama and artificial colors, the Chao Phraya River is filled with gentle monks bobbing around on water taxis. The two cities couldn't be more different. There, saffron is the color of dusk. The river brings peace. The monks got off at Wang Lang pier with their umbrellas and mala rosaries, which traditionally contain 108 beads for the 108 passions of men enumerated by Avalokiteshvara. They looked up at the farang drinking his gin and tonic on the balcony, and that look contained both amusement and distance as it asked, "Is that a lonely man?" The look of Buddha as he extends protection with his left hand raised, abhaya. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>I preferred nights there. The days were too hot and I like heat only when there's no sun. I was a night walker. It is a loneliness which has been chosen and indeed calculated. I spent the small hours on the streets, marauding like a raccoon. I grew to like the atmosphere of stale basil and exhausted marijuana which Bangkok seemed to breathe out of invisible nostrils; I liked the girls who spin past you in the dark with the words "Bai nai?" like coins that have been flipped in a bar. I liked the furious rot. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>I woke up from a siesta in a small white room in the apartment complex called Primrose Apartments. I didn't keep much there. A cut-price Buddha from the Chatuchak market, a bookshelf. I had a carpet from India, too. When you are broke, life is simple. I made myself a gin and tonic on the balcony and waved to the monks. The days were empty by design. I didn't have a job; I was on the lam, as old American gangsters had it. A perfect phrase. The lam. It means "headlong flight," according to my Webster's dictionary. Lamming, to run away. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>Across the hallway lived an Englishman called McGinnis. I wondered if that was a real name, or whether it was a borrowed one. He had an air of upper-class twittery, with his polelike physique stripped of muscle and his linen whites which had missed their era by a wide mark. McGinnis sold air-conditioning systems to Bangkok conference centers and hotels, a profitable business in sweltering Bangkok, and afterhours he said he was compiling an encyclopedia of bars to enrich the lives of others. He looked like a dirty cat at that hour, and I'd see him sitting on his balcony, slowly drinking a Singha mixed with some kind of fruit cordial and eating olives. He looked me in the eye and smiled, as if stroking a cat as well as being one. On the other side was a Spaniard called Helix. Helix&#x2014;not Felix? I thought I'd heard him correctly. Helix the painter, who painted frescoes behind bars in Bangkok conference centers and hotels. They were typical of the profound, talented men you find in Bangkok. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>There were others. On the ground floor lived another expat, an older Scot called Farlo who ran a holiday lodge which he had built himself for adventurous types, in Cambodia. He was a former British Army paratrooper from Dundee, and he wore a beret on the side of his head. Inside that head was lodged a piece of shrapnel from the war in Angola. Cuban shrapnel. You didn't want to cross him drunk in the corridor at night. He'd grab your arm and say, "It's time for a wank, son." <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>At six every night I went down to the street, feeling very much like John Wilmot, earl of Rochester, perfumed from a cold shower. The Primrose opened directly into the street, the way that an elevator opens directly into a penthouse. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>Wang Lang is a pandemonious place in a pandemonious city. Its main drag is so narrow you can feel both sides of it brushing against your hips as you walk through it. As I went sweating between the open kitchens, I was followed by children jeering, "Yak farang, yak farang!" (foreign giant). I was the largest human there, a phenomenon in their eyes, and perhaps worse than that, a genetic accident which couldn't be reversed. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>It was a hospitable place for a man who has done nothing, and who will probably never do anything. For someone with no career, with no prospects, permanently broke, it was the perfect asylum. Its gold-tinted eggs and its bags of oolong tea were virtually free. One could graze continuously on delicasies one had never heard of and still be in pocket. It was well suited to a lazy cunt, in other words, and a natural habitat for a man on the lam who had no objective in his day-to-day life but an inquisitive loitering, a selfless promenading for its own sake. A man who has turned into a ruminant, a goat. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>In Wang Lang I perfected that Thai style of eating on the run called khong kin len, where you pile different ingredients onto a banana leaf as you sail along, walking and pondering at the same time, never losing balance. The streets are culde-sacs, so there is no point in having a direction. They all end in little theaters and caf�s by the water. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>And so I found myself walking up and down, eating those gilded eggs and bits of dried squid, and as night fell the air went ash-gray and the nostrils opened to greet something indefinable, the pungency of "mouse shit" chilies being tossed in hot oil and tamarind paste, and I began to sink like a stone into my own well. The city is nothing more than a protocol for this sinking. Because Bangkok is where some people go when they feel that they can no longer be loved, when they give up. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>It was also true of the other tenants. Broken, disappointed, rejected, they had headed east. During my first nights in Wang Lang I played chess with them in the common room, interested by their dazed, suntanned faces. My most favored, however, was McGinnis. He was a man with no past, a character in a Simenon novel who walks out of his house one day, gets on a train, and kills someone in a distant city. He was from Newhaven. "There's nothing in Newhaven," McGinnis would say, "except sea fortifications," and his face was like that of a pleasant hoodlum who has just shot down a kite. Sea fortifications, I would think: but that's a lot. His head was shaved like a soldier's, like Farlo's, but he was nothing of the sort, with his willowy, elongated frame. He was an engineer with a degree in air-conditioning. It's a subject you can get a degree in. He had acquired his in Sheffield. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>McGinnis was six foot seven. He towered in doorways, in hotel lobbies, in the light of streetlamps. There was something wonderfully sinister there, and I love sinister men. A sinister man doesn't just walk down a street, he rolls down it like a superior ball bearing. A sinister man cannot be amiable, but he can be good company. Despite his association with the science of air-conditioning, McGinnis was also subtly aristocratic and refined, while doing nothing better with his life than selling mass-produced cooling units. It was okay with him. There are aristocrats of the spirit who are mundane in their daily lives. Everything about him was happily self-contained, replete. Is this what made him sinister? <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>It was hotter than usual around Christmastime. In the supermarkets, choirs of girls in red velvet dresses swung brass bells in fur-trimmed hats and chimed out the words to "Silent Night" and "Jingle Bells." The tofu bars had sprigs of plastic holly on them and yuletide slogans crisscrossed the steaming skycrapers of a Buddhist city. The days were windless, our river surged past the Primrose, sloppy and violent, the color of pea soup into which a baby has puked. Its surface was thickened by strands of aquatic weed, and on the far bank the city temples rose like huge stalagmites, or legumes with bristling skins. Somerset Maugham, one of the few Western writers to describe Bangkok in detail, says somewhere that one should be grateful that "something so fantastical exists." <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>Something stirred within me whenever I took my coffee on the balcony in the morning and inhaled the river stench of gasoline and mud. As if a dead leaf on the floor of me were suddenly being lifted and flipped with a small sound, a scratching of dead matter coming to life again. A pricking of the inner lining of the gut. I watched the rice barges crashing toward Klong Tuey port, the gossiping monks with their umbrellas and briefcases ferrying back and forth from those same temples strung out along the river. And behind them the four gold towers of the Royal Palace and, more distantly, Wat Arun sparkling with reflections from a million fragments of glass and ceramic rosebuds, with the sugary ornament of the Italian craftsmen who fashioned them two and a half centuries ago. Monks and schoolchildren in navy blazers, and the men operating the boats blowing ear-splitting whistles as they swept up to the pier. As the tires slung along the boat struck the rotting wood, there was a delicious sound: phuck. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>From here I saw McGinnis doing yoga on his balcony in a jumpsuit, his body elongated to its full length and a trickle of Khmer music coming out of the sliding doors. It was impossible to avoid the other renters at the Primrose because we were always thrust together by the lack of space. He stayed in his yoga position and called over, in his long-exiled accent, "I hear a Spanish guy moved in downstairs the same time as you.

While park roads determine what most visitors see and how they see it, however, few pause to consider when, why, or how the roads they travel on were built. In this extensively researched and richly illustrated book, national parks historian Timothy Davis highlights the unique qualities of park roads, details the factors influencing their design and development, and examines their role in shaping the national park experience&#x2015;from the Blue Ridge Parkway and Skyline Drive to Glacier National Park&#x2019;s Going-to-the-Sun Road, Yellowstone's Grand Loop, Yosemite's Tioga Road, and scores of other scenic drives.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Decisions about park road development epitomize the central challenge of park management: balancing preservation and access in America&#x2019;s most treasured landscapes. Park roads have been celebrated as technical and aesthetic masterpieces, hailed as democratizing influences, and vilified for invading pristine wilderness with the sights, sounds, and smells of civilization. Davis&#x2019;s recounting of efforts to balance the interests of motorists, wilderness advocates, highway engineers, and other stakeholders offers a fresh perspective on national park history while providing insights into evolving ideas about the role of nature, recreation, and technology in American society.</p><p></p><p> </p><p>Tales of strong personalities, imposing challenges, resounding controversies, and remarkable achievements enliven this rich and compelling narrative. Key players include many of the most important figures of conservation history&#x2015;John Muir, Frederick Law Olmsted, wilderness advocates Aldo Leopold, Bob Marshall, and Ansel Adams, and NPS directors Stephen Mather and Horace Albright among them. An engrossing history, <i>National Park Roads</i> will be of interest to national park enthusiasts, academics, design professionals, resource managers, and readers concerned with the past, present, and future of this quintessentially American legacy. As the National Park Service celebrates its centennial, this book offers a fascinating and illuminating account of the agency&#x2019;s impact on American lives and landscapes.</p><p></p></p><p><p>Timothy Davis, a historian with the U.S. National Park Service, has published and lectured widely on America&#x2019;s national parks. He is the coeditor, with Todd Croteau and Christopher Marston, of <i>America&#x2019;s National Park Roads and Parkways: Drawings from the Historic American Engineering Record. </i></p><p>A gracefully written, impeccably researched, major study of something of importance not only to Americans but to anyone interested in public access to regions of scenic, historical, or ecological significance. <i>National Park Roads</i> will be a major work of lasting value, with no other book remotely on its scale or in its class.</p> (John Stilgoe, Harvard University, author of <i>Train Time: Railroads and the Imminent Reshaping of the United States Landscape</i>)<br><br><p>For most Americans, to visit a national park is to experience its roads. While it's easy to lament that fact and to see roads as modern intrusions into otherwise pristine nature, Tim Davis insists that roads and road building sit at the very heart of national park history. Roads shape the view, define the line between preservation and use, and demonstrate above all else that our national parks are landscapes where nature and culture intersect. <i>National Park Roads</i> is a stunning history of the built environment that will change the way we see our national parks.</p> (Paul Sutter, University of Colorado, author of <i>Driven Wild: How the Fight against Automobiles Launched the Modern Wilderness Movement</i>)<br><br><p>More than 5,500 miles of paved roads wind through the national park system. You probably haven&#x2019;t given much thought to any of them, but Timothy Davis has. A Park Service historian, Davis has written "National Park Roads," a fascinating and lavishly illustrated book about those paved ways. They may well be the most important development in the history of the National Park Service.</p> (<i>Washington Post</i>)<br><br><p> <i>National Park Roads</i> details the history of a relationship as fragile and monumental as Glacier National Park&#x2019;s Going-to-the-Sun Road &#x2013; full of ups and downs, twists and turns, challenges and beauty. It is a story that many of us take for granted; after all, a park&#x2019;s road serves as a de facto tour guide for most visitors, and that&#x2019;s due to intricate planning and inventive engineering by park leaders for over 100 years.</p> (<i>National Parks Traveler</i>)<br><br><p>Davis&#x2019;s book is the culmination of decades of changing attitudes towards the roads that shape the experience of national-park landscapes for many millions of visitors each year. He presents these arteries not as necessary evils but as often deeply moving experiences that, for most, shape and enable the greater part of their visit.... More than a means of transportation, [park roads] have been a primary mode of experience. No one understands this more completely than Davis.</p> (<i>Foundation for Landscape Studies</i>)<br><br><p></p><p> This is a must-read for a wide audience of park managers, visitors, and transportation experts, as well as park enthusiasts. There is much to be learned and to be gained from the beautifully produced pages of this book.</p><p></p> (Robert Pavlik, California State Park Rangers Association <i>The CSPRA Wave</i>)<br><br><p>The large-format book combines stunning photographs, both old and new, with historical context and discussions of the purpose and place of park roads. University of Colorado professor Paul Sutter comments: 'Roads share the view, define the line between preservation and use, and demonstrate above all else that our national parks are landscapes where nature and culture intersect.' This book invites you to explore these intersections as you journey through the history of travel in national parks.</p> (<i>High Country News</i>)<br><br><p>"Thoroughly researched, well written, and beautifully illustrated, <i>National Park Roads: A Legacy in the American Landscape</i> will become a standard reference for anyone interested in exploring how and why park roads look the way they do and are located where they are."</p> (William Wyckoff <i>Buildings and Landscapes</i>)</p><h2>Conscripts of Modernity: The Tragedy of Colonial Enlightenment</h2><p>At this stalled and disillusioned juncture in postcolonial history&#x2014;when many anticolonial utopias have withered into a morass of exhaustion, corruption, and authoritarianism&#x2014;David Scott argues the need to reconceptualize the past in order to reimagine a more usable future. He describes how, prior to independence, anticolonialists narrated the transition from colonialism to postcolonialism as romance&#x2014;as a story of overcoming and vindication, of salvation and redemption. Scott contends that postcolonial scholarship assumes the same trajectory, and that this imposes conceptual limitations. He suggests that tragedy may be a more useful narrative frame than romance. In tragedy, the future does not appear as an uninterrupted movement forward, but instead as a slow and sometimes reversible series of ups and downs.<p></p><p>Scott explores the political and epistemological implications of how the past is conceived in relation to the present and future through a reconsideration of C. L. R. James&#x2019;s masterpiece of anticolonial history, <i>The Black Jacobins</i>, first published in 1938. In that book, James told the story of Toussaint L&#x2019;Ouverture and the making of the Haitian Revolution as one of romantic vindication. In the second edition, published in the United States in 1963, James inserted new material suggesting that that story might usefully be told as tragedy. Scott uses James&#x2019;s recasting of <i>The Black Jacobins</i> to compare the relative yields of romance and tragedy. In an epilogue, he juxtaposes James&#x2019;s thinking about tragedy, history, and revolution with Hannah Arendt&#x2019;s in <i>On Revolution</i>. He contrasts their uses of tragedy as a means of situating the past in relation to the present in order to derive a politics for a possible future.<br></p></p><p>&#34;&#34;Conscripts of Modernity&#34; is a highly original and lucidly argued text, a major advance in David Scott&#39;s effort to elaborate a new form of postcolonial criticism in the wake of the collapse of the emancipatory hopes embodied in the anticolonialist moment. Scott&#39;s position will be found controversial by some. But it will not and cannot be ignored.&#34;--Stuart Hall, Emeritus Professor of Sociology, The Open University<p>David Scott is Professor of Anthropology at Columbia University. He is the author of <i>Refashioning Futures: Criticism after Postcoloniality</i> and <i>Formations of Ritual: Colonial and Anthropological Discourses on the Sinhala Yaktovil</i>. He is editor of the journal <i>Small Axe</i>.</p></p><h2>The Negro Cowboys</h2><p>More than five thousand Negro cowboys joined the round-ups and served on the ranch crews in the cattleman era of the West. Lured by the open range, the chance for regular wages, and the opportunity to start new lives, they made vital contributions to the transformation of the West. They, their predecessors, and their successors rode on the long cattle drives, joined the cavalry, set up small businesses, fought on both sides of the law. Some of them became famous: Jim Beckwourth, the mountain man; Bill Pickett, king of the rodeo; Cherokee Bill, the most dangerous man in Indian Territory; and Nat Love, who styled himself "Deadwood Dick." <p>They could hold their own with any creature, man or beast, that got in the way of a cattle drive. They worked hard, thought fast, and met or set the highest standards for cowboys and range riders.</p></p><p></p><h2>Wine Analysis and Production (English and German Edition)</h2><p>Written to provide practical information on wine analysis and wine production for winemakers, laboratory personnel, and students of enology, this book offers a practical understanding of the commonly performed analysis used in the U.S., Europe, and, Australia.

Full facsimile of the original edition, not reproduced with Optical Recognition Software. In economics, money illusion refers to the tendency of people to think of currency in nominal, rather than real, terms. This is a fallacy as modern fiat currencies have no inherent value and their real value is derived from their ability to be exchanged for goods and used for payment of taxes. The term was coined by John Maynard Keynes in the early twentieth century, and Irving Fisher 1928 book, The Money Illusion, is one of the most important works on the subject.</p><p></p><h2>Red Lily (In The Garden Trilogy)</h2><p><b>Three women learn that the heart of their historic home holds a mystery of years gone by, as #1 <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author Nora Roberts brings her In the Garden trilogy to a captivating conclusion.</b><br><br><i>A Harper has always lived at Harper House, the centuries-old mansion just outside of Memphis.

The comprehensive exhibition and accompanying catalogue will feature approximately seventy paintings and works on paper by Hofmann from 1930 through the end of his life in 1966, including works from public and private collections across North America and Europe. Curator Lucinda Barnes builds on new scholarship published over the past ten years and the 2014 catalogue raisonn� to present Hofmann as a unique synthesis of student, artist, teacher, and mentor who transcended generations and continents. His singular artistic achievement drew on artistic influences and innovations that spanned two world wars and transatlantic avant-gardes. Over the last fifty years Hofmann has come to be understood primarily from the vantage of his late color-plane abstractions. <i>Hans Hofmann: The Nature of Abstraction</i> expands our understanding and reinvigorates our appreciation of Hofmann through an inclusive presentation of his artistic arc, showing the vibrant interconnectedness and continuity in his work of European and American influences from the early twentieth century through the advent of abstract expressionism.<br><br> Published in association with the Berkeley Museum of Art Pacific Film Archive (BAMPFA).<br><br> Exhibition dates:<br> Berkeley Museum of Art Pacific Film Archive (BAMPFA): February 27&#x2013;July 21, 2019<br> The Peabody Essex Museum, Salem, MA: September 21, 2019&#x2013;January 6, 2020</p><p><b>Lucinda Barnes</b> serves as Curator Emerita at the University of California, Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive, after many years as Chief Curator and Director of Programs and Collections.

The Nazis may have given eugenics its negative connotations, but the practice--and the &#34;science&#34; that supports it--is still disturbingly alive in America in anti-immigration initiatives, the quest for a &#34;gay gene, &#34; and theories of collective intelligence. Tracing the historical roots and persistence of eugenics in the United States, Nancy Ordover explores the political and cultural climate that has endowed these campaigns with mass appeal and scientific legitimacy. American Eugenics demonstrates how biological theories of race, gender, and sexuality are crucially linked through a concern with regulating the &#34;unfit.&#34; These links emerge in Ordover&#39;s examination of three separate but ultimately related American eugenics campaigns: early twentieth-century anti-immigration crusades; medical models and interventions imposed on (and sometimes embraced by) lesbians, gays, transgendered people, and bisexuals; and the compulsory sterilization of poor women and women of color. Throughout, her work reveals how constructed notions of race, gender, sexuality, and nation are put to ideological uses and how &#34;faith in science&#34; can undermine progressive social movements, drawing liberals and conservatives alike into eugenics-based discourse and policies.</p><p></p><h2>Beneath the Depths: A Detective Byron Mystery (A John Byron Novel, 2)</h2><p><p><strong><em>Maine Sunday Telegram</em> #1 Bestseller</strong></p><p><strong>In this latest gripping mystery from bestselling author Bruce Robert Coffin, Detective Sergeant John Byron is back</strong>&#x2014;<strong>and ready to prove that no one on his beat is above the law.</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>When the body of prominent Portland attorney Paul Ramsey turns up in the bottom of Casco Bay, following his loss of a multimillion dollar civil trial, Byron knows it's no accidental drowning.

Westerhoff</p><h2>On Drugs</h2><p>It has been more than twenty years since President Nixon declared the War on Drugs. In On Drugs, David Lenson delivers a scathing indictment of this war as an effort based, like all attempts to eradicate &#34;getting high,&#34; on an incomplete understanding of human nature. From lotus-eaters to hippies to crackheads, he contends, history has shown the state&#39;s inability to legislate the bloodstreams of its citizens. Lenson ventures beyond conventional genres to view the drug debate from the largely forgotten perspective of those who use drugs. In successfully walking the fine line between the antidrug hysteria of the 1980s and an advocacy of drug use, Lenson shatters the ban on debate regarding drugs enforced in the &#34;Just Say No&#34; campaign and reveals the myriad ways &#34;straight society&#34; demonizes the drug user. After considering several specific issues associated with drug use - including sex, violence, and money - Lenson concludes with his vision of the end of the Drug War by questioning the sense in condemning millions of Americans to lives of concealment and deceit.</p><p>Unlike Thomas Szasz, who argues forcefully for the legalization of drugs in Our Right to Drugs (Praeger, 1992), Lenson tackles this subject by meditating on the national consumerist paradigm, the way the war on drugs closed avenues for heterogeneity, the lack of a vocabulary to describe changes in a user's consciousness, the senselessness of talking about "drugs" indiscriminately, and the differences among the users, the drugs, and the effects of psychedelics, cannabis, stimulants (cocaine, crack, amphetamines), depressants (heroin), opiates, and alcohol. He contrasts drugs of pleasure to drugs of desire and believes that "to legislate against drugs of pleasure is like legislating against music, chess, golf...." Lenson says that nothing in his professional life qualifies him to write about drugs, but his style and his literary and philosophical references would pinpoint him as an academic even if he were not identified as a University of Massachusetts professor of literature, albeit one who surveys his students' usage habits. Lenson's credentials as a user were probably the impetus for this work, but they are not much evident in the text. In the national debate and reevaluation of attitudes toward drugs, this is a different kind of contribution, one that is speculative, discursive, and visionary.

I heartily commend this book.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Jerry Bridges</strong>, author, <em>The Pursuit of Holiness</em></p><p>&#x201c;The Westminster Shorter Catechism tells us that 'man's chief end is to glorify God and enjoy him forever.' In this book, the authors bring that affirmation to life by showing us that the Trinity is not just a doctrine to be believed but a relationship to be experienced and enjoyed. Pastors, teachers, and believers everywhere will be refreshed and challenged by this stirring call to a deeper participation in the love of the triune God.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Gerald Bray</strong><strong>, </strong>Research Professor of Divinity, History, and Doctrine, Beeson Divinity School;&nbsp;author, <em>God Is Love </em>and <em>God Has Spoken</em></p><p>&#x201c;At a time when Biblical theology gets more attention among pastors, the twin advantages of systematic theology&#x2015;namely that it will hold you to orthodoxy in the face of difficult Biblical texts and that it is organized according to the categories in which the non-Christian world speaks and thinks&#x2015;cannot be underestimated. With this as backdrop, Ryken and LeFebvre's <em>Our Triune God</em> fills a void in Christian literature. The chapters are formed as carefully reasoned expositions on the subject of the Trinity, and as such, this book provides us with a model worth emulating across the spectrum of systematic categories.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>David R.

He is a member of the editorial board of the New York Times and has written for The New Yorker, Harper&#39;s, Esquire, National Geographic, Mother Jones, and the New York Times Magazine, among other publications. He lives in upstate New York.Klinkenborg's third book (after Making Hay and The Last Fine Time) is a selection of columns originally appearing on the New York Times editorial page under the heading "A Rural Life." They document in vivid detail the daily challenges of life in the country, and on a farm in particular. Though the columns are drawn from seven years of writing, the book is organized into a single year-12 chapters starting in "January" and ending in "December"-and flits from topic to topic, relying on a few short passages of news or descriptions of holidays to mark the passage of time. Likewise, the author never sticks to one place for long, but ranges across the continent of the U.S. and glimpses events in dozens of country towns from Wyoming and New Hampshire to Minnesota and New Mexico. Some episodes are emblematic of contemporary American culture: a high school football game, President Clinton's dedication of Walden Pond, the disquiet in the days following September 11. Others are more intimate passages discussing the author's family and the solace he finds in keeping bees, stacking hay or simply turning earth. Though this highly personal chronicle lacks any narrative arc other than the changing of the seasons and the author's emotional reaction to them, nothing in the prose is accidental, and the deliberate, finely hewn sentences convey, above all else, the seriousness with which Klinkenborg takes the task of watching the world around him. A heady meditation on our relationship to nature, echoing the works of the transcendentalists Thoreau and Emerson, the writing is much closer to poetry than essay.<br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Shadowfell</h2><p>Sixteen-year-old Neryn is alone in the land of Alban, where the oppressive king has ordered anyone with magical strengths captured and brought before him.

She is also the author of the teen novels <i>Wildwood Dancing</i> and <i>Cybele's Secret</i>.<p>Chapter One<br><br>As we came down to the shore of Darkwater, the wind sliced cold right to my bones. My heels stung with blisters. Dusk was falling, and my head was muzzy from the weariness of another long day&#x2019;s walk. Birds cried out overhead, winging to nighttime roosts. They were as eager as I was to get out of the chill.<br><br>We&#x2019;d heard there was a settlement not far along the loch shore, a place where we might perhaps buy shelter with our fast-�shrinking store of coppers. I allowed myself to imagine a bed, a proper one with a straw mattress and a woolen coverlet. Oh, how my limbs ached for warmth and comfort! Foolish hope. The way things were in Alban, people didn&#x2019;t open their doors to strangers. Especially not to disheveled vagrants, and that was what we had become. I was a fool to believe, even for a moment, that our money would buy us time by someone&#x2019;s hearth fire and a real bed. Never mind that. A heap of old sacks in a net-�mending shed or a pile of straw in a barn would do fine. Anyplace out of this wind. Anyplace out of sight.<br><br>I became aware of silence. Father&#x2019;s endless mumbled recounting of past sorrows, a constant accompaniment to our day&#x2019;s journey, had come to a halt, and now he stopped walking to gaze ahead. Between the water&#x2019;s edge and the looming darkness of a steep wooded hillside, I could make out a cluster of dim lights.<br><br>&#x201c;Darkwater settlement,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;There are lights down by the jetty. The boat&#x2019;s there!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What boat?&#x201d; I was slow to understand, my mind dreaming of a fire, a bowl of porridge, a blanket. I did not hear the note in his voice, the one that meant trouble.<br><br>&#x201c;Fowler&#x2019;s boat. The chancy-�boat, Neryn. What have we got left&#x2014;how much?&#x201d;<br><br>My heart plummeted. When this mood took him, setting the glitter of impossible hope in his eyes, there was no stopping him. I could not restrain him by force; he was too strong for me. And whatever I said, he would ignore it. But I had to try.<br><br>&#x201c;Enough for two nights&#x2019; shelter and maybe a crust if we&#x2019;re lucky, Father. There&#x2019;s nothing to spare. Nothing until one of us gets some paid work, and you know how likely that is.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Give me the bag.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Father, no! These coppers are our safe place to sleep. They&#x2019;re our shelter from the wind. Don&#x2019;t you remember what happened last&#x2014;�&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t tell me what to do, daughter.&#x201d; His eyes narrowed in a way that was all too familiar. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s better than a drink of ale to warm us up? Besides, I&#x2019;ll double our coppers on the boat. Triple them. Nobody beats me in a game of chance. Would you doubt your father, girl?&#x201d;<br><br>Doubt was hardly the word for what I felt. Yes, he had once been skilled in such games. He&#x2019;d had a reputation as a tricky player, full of surprises. Sorrow and reversal, hardship and humiliation, had eaten up that clever fellow, leaving a pathetic shell, a man who liked his ale too much and could no longer distinguish between reality and wild dream. Father was a danger to himself. And he was a danger to me, for strong drink loosened his tongue, and a word out of place could reveal the gift I fought to hide from the world every moment of every day. He&#x2019;d talk, and someone would tell the Enforcers, and it would all be over for the two of us. But I was heartsick and weary&#x2014;�too weary to fight him any longer.<br><br>&#x201c;Here,&#x201d; I said, handing over the bag. &#x201c;I hate the chancy-�boat. The only chance it will give you tonight is the chance to squander what little we have. If you lose this money, we&#x2019;ll be sleeping out in the open, at the mercy of whoever happens to pass by. If you lose it, you&#x2019;ll lose what little self-�respect you have left. But you&#x2019;re my father, and I can&#x2019;t make your choices for you.&#x201d;<br><br>He looked at me directly, just for a moment, and I thought I saw a glimmer of understanding in his eyes, but it was gone as quickly as it had appeared. &#x201c;You hate me,&#x201d; he muttered. &#x201c;You despise your own father.&#x201d;<br><br>I could have told him the truth: that I hated his weakness, that I hated his anger, that the days and months and years of looking after him and keeping him out of trouble and protecting him from himself had worn me down. But I loved him too. He was my father. I loved the man he used to be, and I still hadn&#x2019;t given up hope that, someday, he could be that man again. &#x201c;No, Father,&#x201d; I said, plodding after him as he strode ahead, for the prospect of a game and a win had put new life in his step. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m cold and tired, that&#x2019;s all. Too tired to mind my words.&#x201d;<br><br>As we made our way closer to the lights of the chancy-�boat, which rocked gently in the dark water beside a small jetty, I was aware of pale eyes watching me from the branches of the pines. I did not allow myself a glance toward them. Small feet shuffled in the fallen leaves and pattered along behind us a way, then skipped off into the woods. I did not allow myself to turn back. A whisper teased at me: Neryn! Neryn, we are here! I closed my ears to it. I had been hiding my secret for years, since Grandmother had explained the peril of canny gifts. I had become adept at concealment.<br><br>I stiffened my spine and gritted my teeth. Maybe there would be nobody on the chancy-�boat but its captain, Fowler, who had some understanding of my father&#x2019;s situation. Who would want to spend such a chilly night playing games anyway? Who would be visiting such an out-�of-�the-�way place as Darkwater? We had come here because the settlement lay so far from well-�traveled roads. We had come because nobody knew us in these parts. Except Fowler, and we had not expected him. But Fowler wouldn&#x2019;t talk. He was a bird of passage, a loner.</p></p><h2>Jacob&#39;s Ladder: On Angels</h2><p>Few of Sergius Bulgakov&#x2019;s professional writings achieve the lyrical heights of Jacob&#x2019;s Ladder. In it he discusses the doctrine of angels and their importance for contemporary humanity. He includes reflections on the meaning of love, the sexes, death, and the Christian hope of resurrection, meditating on the Wisdom of God in the creation. <br><br>This work completes the word picture of divinized and Sophianic creation begun in The Burning Bush and The Friend of the Bridegroom, which together constitute what scholars call Bulgakov&#x2019;s &#x201c;major,&#x201d; or first, trilogy.</p><p>Sergius Bulgakov (1871-1944) is widely regarded as the twentieth century&#39;s leading Orthodox theologian.<b>Boris Jakim</b><br>"Written by Bulgakov after a near-death encounter with an angelic being who led him back to life, Jacob's Ladder possesses a mystical intensity almost beyond words. Using doctrinal, scriptural, liturgical, iconographic, and personal experiential data, Bulgakov provides a theological interpretation of the doctrine of angels. Its lyrical beauty and its profound speculative reflections make this book very difficult to translate, but Thomas Allan Smith has more than met the challenge, offering English-speaking readers what is undoubtedly the greatest work of angelology in the modern Orthodox literature."<br><br><b>Myroslaw Tatryn</b><br>"Bulgakov masterfully intertwines the multistranded Christian tradition into not simply a tract on angels but, more importantly, a profound and beautiful rhapsody on divine love as manifested in both the angelic and the human realm. This is not a simple book about angels but, rather, a radiant and hope-filled symphony beginning with words of love -- 'God-Love created human beings for love' -- and culminating in joy: 'How great is the joy bestowed on humankind knowing this!' No small recognition is owed Thomas Allan Smith for working a difficult Russian text into a flowing and enjoyably readable English translation."</p><h2>The Diabetes Cookbook: 300 Healthy Recipes for Living Powered by the Diabetes Food Hub</h2><p><p><strong>The ultimate diabetes cookbook from the American Diabetes Association, the world's foremost expert in diabetes nutrition.</strong> <em>The Diabetes Cookbook: 300 Recipes for Healthy Living Powered by the Diabetes Food Hub</em> is a big, bold, and beautiful book, packed with hundreds of recipes specifically designed for those with diabetes or prediabetes and backed by more than 75 years of evidence-based diabetes nutrition research.</p><p>Designed to make healthy eating easier, realistic, and delicious for people, this cookbook collects together for the first time hundreds of recipes and meals tested on people living with diabetes and their families.

Gorman argues that most models of the atonement over-emphasize the penultimate purposes of Jesus&#39; death and the &#34;mechanics&#34; of the atonement, rather than its ultimate purpose: to create a transformed, Spirit-filled people of God. The New Testament&#39;s various atonement metaphors are part of a remarkably coherent picture of Jesus&#39; death as that which brings about the new covenant (and thus the new community) promised by the prophets, which is also the covenant of peace. Gorman therefore proposes a new model of the atonement that is really not new at all-the new-covenant model. He argues that this is not merely an ancient model in need of rediscovery, but also a more comprehensive, integrated, participatory, communal, and missional model than any of the major models in the tradition. Life in this new covenant, Gorman argues, is a life of communal and individual participation in Jesus&#39; faithful, loving, peacemaking death. Written for both academics and church leaders, this book will challenge all who read it to re-think and re-articulate the meaning of Christ&#39;s death for us.</p><p>Michael J. Gorman holds the Raymond E. Brown Chair in Biblical Studies and Theology at St. Mary's Seminary &amp; University in Baltimore. He is the author of 10 books, including the best-selling Reading Paul and Reading Revelation Responsibly (both from Cascade), as well as Cruciformity: Paul's Narrative Spirituality of the Cross and Elements of Biblical Exegesis.''Atonement theologies have for some become atonement wars that mirror culture wars. Atonement theologies have become obsessed with the mechanics of atonement, that is, how God accomplished atonement--how justice was dealt with, how sin was erased, how God's wrath was pacified. Far too often atonement theologies have focused on what is less known and ignored what is known. Michael Gorman in <i>The Death of the Messiah and the Birth of the New Covenant</i>, has accomplished keeping our eyes on what is known: that in the death and resurrection of Jesus, God has formed a new covenant people.''<br>--Scot McKnight, Professor of New Testament, Northern Baptist Theological Seminary, Lombard, IL<br><br>''This book, what a gem! Gorman situates atonement in the new messianic cruciform covenant, fulfilling OT visions of peace. Reorienting standard atonement theories, Gorman grounds atonement where it belongs, in Jesus's gospel of peace, love-driven death, and new covenant! Virtually all NT writings bear witness. Salvation, politics, and spirituality shine in new light. The bibliography is rich. This is an essential read and resource for New Testament theology-ethics.''<br>--Willard M. Swartley, Professor emeritus of New Testament, Anabaptist Mennonite Biblical Seminary, Elkhart, IN<br><br>''With this biblically and theologically mature study, Michael Gorman shifts our focus away from fascination with the how of the atonement and toward reflection on the what: What does Jesus's death accomplish? The result is a richly textured statement of how the atonement reaches deeply into the scriptural story of God's mighty acts in order to present the consequences of the cross for the church's faith, hope, and love.''<br>--Joel B. Green, Dean, School of Theology, Fuller Theological Seminary, Pasadena, CA <br><br>''Traditional atonement theories, often historically unmoored from the large narrative of Scripture, try their best to articulate what we are saved from. Gorman's book sounds the clarion call of the New Testament found in Jesus Christ--that ultimately we have been saved for and called to spirit-empowered, cruciform discipleship in Christ as children of God's new covenant of shalom. As the New Testament atonement metaphors rest within the grand scope of God's covenant of salvation, we hear afresh the truly astonishing good news of the gospel!''<br>--Cherith Fee Nordling, Professor of Theology, Northern Baptist Theological Seminary, Lombard, IL<br><br>''Spread the word! The New Testament demands that Christ's atonement on the cross must bring forth a holy witness in the very practices of each and every Christian parish and congregation. Thanks to Michael Gorman for taking us beyond endless discussions of the 'how' of Christ's atonement to its visible end, Christ's atonement as manifest in the life of the church for the sake of the world!''<br>--John W.

Written during his exile from war-torn Europe, <i>Man and the State</i> is the fruit of Maritain's considerable learning as well as his reflections on his positive American experience and on the failure of regimes he closely encountered on the Continent."&#x2015;Jude P. Dougherty, The Catholic University of America </p><p>"The lectures that were the basis for <i>Man and the State</i> were delivered at the University of Chicago at a time when Maritain was still in the first enthusiasm of his participation in the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights. He devotes particular attention to the concept of rights, since, historically, rights theories were fashioned to supplant the natural law theory to which Maritain as a Thomist gives his allegiance. Maritain provides an ingenious and profound theory as to how natural law and natural rights can be complementary. For this reason alone it remains a fundamental contribution to political philosophy, but it is filled with other gems as well. Was Maritain too optimistic in his appraisal of modernity? Or have we unjustly lost the optimism that was his? <i>Man and the State</i> is an invitation to rethink the way we pose the basic questions of political philosophy."&#x2015;Ralph McInerny, Jacques Maritain Center, University of Notre Dame</p><br><p></p><br><br><p>ABOUT THE AUTHOR</p><br><br><p>Jacques Maritain (1882-1973), distinguished French Catholic philosopher and writer, was the author of more than fifty books.

Although Alcott secretly wrote pulp fiction, harbored radical abolitionist views, and served as a Civil War nurse, her novels went on to sell more copies than those of Herman Melville and Henry James. Stories and details culled from Alcott's journals, together with revealing letters to family, friends, and publishers, plus recollections of her famous contemporaries provide the basis for this lively account of the author's classic rags-to-riches tale. In <i>Louisa May Alcott</i>, the extraordinary woman behind the beloved American classic <i>Little Women</i> is revealed as never before.</p></p><p><p>Harriet Reisen has written dramatic and historical scripts for PBS and HBO, including a recent PBS documentary on Louisa May Alcott. She lives in Massachusetts with her husband and son.</p><p>ONEFIT FOR THE<br>SCUFFLE OF THINGS<br>She has &#x201c;a fine foundation for health and energy of character,&#x201d; Bronson Alcott wrote to his father-in-law within hours of the birth of his second daughter on November 29, 1832. &#x201c;[She] is a very fine healthful child, much more so than Anna was at birth.&#x201d; He had wished for a boy, but he was linked to Louisa by a coincidence rarer than a common gender: &#x201c;She was born at half-past 12 this morning on my birthday (33).&#x201d;<br>Although they shared a birthday, Louisa May Alcott and her father were born under different stars. From the first, Louisa displayed her mother&#x2019;s moody, passionate temperament. She was an autumn hurricane arriving twenty months after Anna, a veritable March lamb, a paragon of a baby with her father&#x2019;s calm temperament. Louisa&#x2019;s version of her vexed beginnings matched her sense that life had been one long battle from the start. &#x201c;On a dismal November day I found myself, &amp; began my long fight,&#x201d; she wrote on her twenty-third birthday. Her first fight would be for supremacy over her sister. Her mother would be her best ally.Abigail May Alcott&#x2019;s family was a distinguished one, especially on her mother&#x2019;s side. Dorothy Sewall May was the daughter of Samuel Sewall, the deacon of Old South Church, from whose steps Samuel Adams had signaled the start of the Boston Tea Party in 1773. The Sewalls were related to the Quincys and the Adamses; Abigail&#x2019;s aunt Dorothy Quincy&#x2019;s second marriage was to John Hancock. Born in 1800, Abigail (called Abby or Abba) was the youngest of the May family&#x2019;s eight surviving children.<br>Colonel Joseph May, Abigail&#x2019;s father and Louisa&#x2019;s grandfather, came from a humbler line. (The title &#x201c;colonel&#x201d; was a memento not of wartime service but of his rank in a teenage cadet corps during the Revolution.) The son of a modestly successful lumber dealer, Joseph May met Dorothy Sewall when he was a thirteen-year-old apprentice in her uncle&#x2019;s store. Enterprising and ambitious, by age thirty Colonel May was a rich and gregarious man known for his honesty, his love of learning, his charitable works, and his support of liberal causes. He was one of the best informed men of his day, according to a family biographer. Outside the family he was distinguished by his snuff habit and for wearing outmoded black silk stockings and knee buckles. All Boston knew of Colonel May&#x2019;s vanity about his shapely legs, which he claimed were the models for George Washington&#x2019;s in the full-length Gilbert Stuart portrait.<br>The Colonel&#x2019;s easy course through life hit a snag in 1799, the year before Abigail was born, when he was involved in a disastrous investment. To clear his debts and his name, thirty-eight-year-old Joseph May gave up everything he owned, selling even the gold rings on his fingers. He vowed never again to pursue wealth, took a part-time salaried job in a shipping insurance office, and sold his grand mansion on Atkinson (now Congress) Street. He moved his family to a modest place on Federal Court. May&#x2019;s was by all accounts a happy household, alive with music and intellectual engagement.<br>Abby was very attached to her father, although she later felt she could never live up to his high expectations. She was a much loved and indulged child, yet near the end of her life, she began her brief memoir on a deeply mournful note: &#x201c;I was the youngest of twelve children, born sickly, nursed by a sickly mother.&#x201d; The roots of Abigail&#x2019;s lifelong melancholy and sense of having been shortchanged may lie in a childhood dominated by her mother&#x2019;s declining health, the ghosts of siblings she never knew, and the subsequent deaths of other siblings she had known and loved.<br>Abby idealized her mother as Louisa would in turn idealize Abby as &#x201c;Marmee&#x201d; in Little Women. &#x201c;She adored her husband and children,&#x201d; Abby wrote of Dorothy. &#x201c;She loved the whole human family.&#x201d; Dorothy May had twelve pregnancies in sixteen years, several times burying an infant and giving its name to a successor: two Charleses, two Louisas, and three Samuels. When Abby was only a year old, her six-year-old brother Edward&#x2014;&#x201c;a fair-haired boy, with blue eyes, bright, playful, affectionate&#x201d; in his younger brother Sam&#x2019;s recollection&#x2014;impaled himself on a post while playing in the backyard and bled to death in his mother&#x2019;s arms. Two of Abby&#x2019;s married sisters preceded her mother to the grave; only Abby, Charles, and Sam would live to see their own children grow up.<br>In her earliest years Abby was allowed to tag along after her older brother Sam to school in Boston&#x2019;s High Street; later she was given private lessons. Both Sam and her older sister Louisa took an active interest in Abby&#x2019;s intellectual development. From Harvard Sam corresponded with Abby about his readings in philosophy, while at home Louisa urged Abby to concentrate on her studies.<br>Abby shared her father&#x2019;s love of music and reading, and favored him in appearance&#x2014;the same thick eyebrows above deep-set brown eyes, the same sloping nose, fine upper lip, and vivid complexion. But where her father was steady and careful, Abby was mercurial and rash. By her own account, Abby &#x201c;was a good child&#x2014;but willful.&#x201d;<br>When her parents suggested she marry one of her May cousins, Sam Frothingham, she resisted the idea; she wanted a love match. Her brother and ally Sam proposed to their parents that Abby spend a year studying with a Reverend Allyn in Duxbury, about thirty-five miles south of Boston. The courses in moral philosophy, natural theology, science, history, and Latin left Abby with a fleeting sense of possibility that she and her sister Louisa might together open a school. &#x201c;I may yet earn my bread by the knowledge this year has afforded me. I am not willing to be thought incapable of anything,&#x201d; she wrote, as honest a self-assessment as she would ever make. Aware of his sister&#x2019;s inclination to despondency, Sam wrote to her of the importance of &#x201c;a cheerful habit of mind. Cheerfulness is a kind of oil to the springs, and wheels of life.... Without it they may move, but they will move [badly and] all our duties will be performed with pain.&#x201d;<br>It was advice she was constitutionally unable to follow. Her Duxbury sojourn did not make her happier, and, living under threat of an unwanted marriage, Abby could scarcely believe in any of her schemes for an independent life. Then, in August 1819, Sam Frothingham died unexpectedly. Abby insisted she be excused from any obligation to pay or receive calls. &#x201c;If I incur the epithet pedantic or unsocial or misanthropic, I must bear it patiently,&#x201d; she wrote, but patience was not a virtue she possessed. Louisa Alcott would not have it either.<br>Abby&#x2019;s dream of starting a school with her sister ended with Louisa May&#x2019;s marriage in 1823. She turned to her brother Sam, now a Unitarian minister embarking upon a distinguished career as a radical reformer as eloquent and fierce as he was sweet-tempered. Abby became a regular visitor at his home in the town of Brooklyn in eastern Connecticut, cheering on Sam&#x2019;s efforts to reform education, and taking to his wife, Lucretia (&#x201c;Lu&#x201d;), as a sister.<br>Abby&#x2019;s mother, Dorothy Sewall May, died in 1825; less than a year later Colonel Joseph May remarried. His new wife was just fourteen years older than his only remaining unmarried daughter. As a spinster of twenty-five, Abby could have hoped and expected to take on the role of lady of the house to her widowed father. Instead, disaffected with her father for remarrying and displaced by her stepmother, she paid a visit of indefinite length to her brother and congenial sister-in-law. On a hot afternoon in July of 1827, she was alone at the parsonage when a towering blue-eyed young man appeared at the door looking for Sam. Abby was almost twenty-seven and ripe for a serious attachment. After five minutes alone with Bronson Alcott, she was sure she had found it.<br>Of the small band of radical thinkers who defined the Transcendentalist movement of the early nineteenth century, Bronson Alcott was possibly the most original, certainly the most improbable. He was born Amos Bronson Alcox in the last year of the eighteenth century, into an isolated clan of farmers long settled in the northwestern corner of Connecticut. Their only news came in small weekly doses of the Connecticut Courant, read by the few literate to the many illiterate members of the family, among the latter Joseph Alcox, Bronson&#x2019;s father. Bronson&#x2019;s mother, Anna Bronson Alcox, though a genuine rustic who smoked a corncob pipe, could read, and taught her eager son to write the alphabet in the sand she used to sweep clean the kitchen floor of the home they called Spindle Hill. She praised his gift for drawing too. Bronson was the first of Anna Alcox&#x2019;s eight children (of ten) to live past infancy; mother and son adored each other.<br>Bronson&#x2019;s years of rudimentary country education, interrupted for spring planting and the fall harvest, ended when he was thirteen. He and his cousin William Alcox, also avid for knowledge, embarked upon an ambitious plan of private study. Their self-improvement program extended to their surname: their common paternal grandfather, a Revolutionary War veteran, was Captain John Alcock, not Alcox. The pun-inviting family name was spelled several different ways, and none conjured the image of a cultivated gentleman. Young Bronson and William came up with the more refined &#x201c;Alcott.&#x201d; William took up a middle name, &#x201c;Andrus,&#x201d; and Bronson further improved his handle by reducing the plain &#x201c;Amos&#x201d; to its initial A. They assembled their own library of stray books hoarded by relatives, now and then scraping together enough money to purchase a volume. They acquired the poems of Pope, a volume of Milton, a copy of Robinson Crusoe, and more Bibles than they could use. They began a corr...</p></p><h2>When the Shooting Stops... the Cutting Begins (Da Capo Paperback)</h2><p>The story of one of the most important and least-understood jobs in moviemaking-film editing-is here told by one of the wizards, Ralph Rosenblum, whose credentials include six Woody Allen films, as well as <i>The Pawnbroker, The Producers</i>, and <i>Goodbye, Columbus</i>.

Burrows, a treasure hunter in southern Illinois, stumbled on a cache of ancient weapons, jewels, and gold sarcophagi in a remote cave.

Following the execution of their son, Ptolemy, by Emperor Caligula, the Mauretanians rebelled against their Roman overlords and made their way into what is now Ghana. There they constructed a fleet of ships for a transatlantic voyage to a land where they hoped to rebuild their kingdom safe from Roman rule.

No one interested in the real story of America&#x2019;s prehistory can afford to ignore this book.&#x201d; <br>--Steven Sora, author of <em>Secret Societies of America&#x2019;s Elite <br></em> <br>In 1982 Russell E. Burrows, a treasure hunter in southern Illinois, stumbled on a hidden cave and its cache of ancient gold sarcophagi and statues, gold medallions, and weapons. There were also hundreds of black &#x201c;portrait stones,&#x201d; inscribed with various symbols and letters and the profiles of Roman soldiers, ancient Jews, early Christians, and West Africans. <br> <br>Researching more than 7,000 artifacts removed from the cave before it was sealed--and gathering the opinions of a number of experts in archeology, the history and languages of ancient cultures, and geology--Frank Joseph pieces together how these objects came to be buried in the middle of the United States. Almost 2,000 years ago Cleopatra Selene, daughter of Cleopatra, ruled the semi-independent Roman province of Mauretania, in present-day Morocco, with her husband, King Juba II. Following the execution of their son, Ptolemy, by Emperor Caligula, the Mauretanians rebelled against their Roman overlords. The Roman legions attacked, pushing them down the west coast of Africa in retreat. To escape, the Mauretanians constructed a fleet of ships with the help of West Africans for a transatlantic voyage to a land where they hoped to safely rebuild their kingdom. Taking with them two great prizes--Cleopatra&#x2019;s golden treasure and King Juba&#x2019;s encyclopedic library of ancient wisdom--and using the maps and navigational knowledge of their ancestors, they sailed past the Canary Islands, following the same route that Columbus was later to take on his famous voyage of discovery. Illustrated with over a hundred photographs of artifacts retrieved from the southern Illinois site, <em>The Lost Treasure of King Juba</em> is a compelling story that could force us to rethink the early history of our nation and the possibility that Africans landed on our continent nearly fifteen centuries before Columbus. <br> <br>FRANK JOSEPH is the editor-in-chief of <em>Ancient American</em> magazine and the author of <em>The Destruction of Atlantis</em> and <em>Synchronicity and You</em>.

Richard Dawkins suggests a meme&#x2019;s success comes from its effectiveness to the host. But history shows that destructive memes can spread just as rapidly through society. MEMETIC shows the progression of a weaponized meme that leads to the utter annihilation of the human race within 72 hours. The root of this apocalypse is a single image on the internet, a &#x201c;meme&#x201d; in the popular sense. A meme that changes everything.<br> <br> MEMETIC shows the true terror of the internet.

He has since written stories for Detective Comics, as well as writing the ongoing series Talon, and Red Hood and the Outlaws. He lives and writes in New York City, and is consistently amazed that people are actually letting him work on comic books professionally.

While many books have been published documenting jewelry artifacts of Africa, few have documented the makers, their process and their traditions until now. <p>Part technical guide, part anthropological study, Legacy offers a glimpse into the daily lives and work habits of the jewelers of West Africa. Author Matthieu Chimin�e traveled to seven countries, interviewed hundreds of craftsmen and took thousands of photographs over the course of a decade to compile this comprehensive resource. While metalsmiths in the West will be fascinated and humbled by the techniques presented here, all readers will glean insight into African culture and art as they stand today, a legacy from ancestors. </p><p>In this beautiful and personal volume, readers are invited to visit the sparse market stalls, examine the heirloom tools and meet the craftsmen responsible for the living tradition of jewelry in West Africa. <i>Legacy<i></i> offers step-by-step investigations into many working processes as well as fascinating anecdotes and biographies of the artists. The book is illustrated with hundreds of beautiful photographs and offers access to a world not often visited by outsiders. Equally relevant as an instructional guide and as a profound glimpse into the artistic heritage of Africa, this book adds something fresh and dynamic to the academic study of African art.</i></p></p><p>Matthieu Chemin�e is a Parisian-born jeweler, photographer and teacher whose training spans three continents. As a young man he lived in Taos, New Mexico where he learned traditional jewelry techniques from Native American masters. He then moved to Mali in West Africa where he worked with jewelers and first encountered the legacy of this ancient craft. After three years in Africa, Chemin�e moved to Montreal, Canada where he lives now. His time in Africa left a deep impact on the author and he has maintained strong ties to local individuals and institutions ever since. In addition to organizing conferences, Chemin�e offers master classes in Canada where he passes along the techniques of West African jewelers. The revenue generated in these workshops goes back to Africa to assist jewelers and their families.</p><h2>Lonely Planet Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos &amp; Northern Thailand (Travel Guide)</h2><p><p><i>Lonely Planet: The world's leading travel guide publisher</i> </p><p><b>Lonely Planet </b><b>Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos &amp; Northern Thailand</b> is your passport to the most relevant, up-to-date advice on what to see and skip, and what hidden discoveries await you.

It was prized by the pharaohs of ancient Egypt as a sacred food. Today palm oil is the most widely used oil in the world. In tropical Africa and Southeast Asia it is an integral part of a healthy diet just as olive oil is in the Mediterranean. Palm oil possesses excellent cooking properties. It is more heat stable than other vegetable oils and imparts in foods and baked goods superior taste, texture, and quality. Palm oil is one of the world&#x2019;s healthiest oils. As a natural vegetable oil, it contains no trans fatty acids or cholesterol. It is currently being used by doctors and government agencies to treat specific illnesses and improve nutritional status. Recent medical studies have shown that palm oil, particularly virgin (red) palm oil, can protect against many common health problems. Some of the health benefits include: Improves blood circulation Protects against heart disease Protects against cancer Improves blood sugar control Improves nutrient absorption and vitamin and mineral status Aids in the prevention and treatment of malnutrition Supports healthy lung function Supports healthy liver function Helps strengthen bones and teeth Supports eye health Highest natural source of health promoting tocotrienols Helps protect against mental deterioration, including Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease Richest dietary source of vitamin D and beta-carotene Boosts immunity</p><p>Bruce Fife, CN, ND, is an author, speaker, certified nutritionist, and naturopath.

But while trying to solve the many mysteries of the case, Massu would unravel a plot of unspeakable deviousness. <br>&nbsp;<br>The main suspect, Dr. Marcel Petiot, was a handsome, charming physician with remarkable charisma. He was the &#x201c;People&#x2019;s Doctor,&#x201d; known for his many acts of kindness and generosity, not least in providing free medical care for the poor. Petiot, however, would soon be charged with twenty-seven murders, though authorities suspected the total was considerably higher, perhaps even as many as 150.<br><br>Petiot's trial quickly became a circus. Attempting to try all twenty-seven cases at once, the prosecution stumbled in its marathon cross-examinations, and Petiot, enjoying the spotlight, responded with astonishing ease. Soon, despite a team of prosecuting attorneys, dozens of witnesses, and over one ton of evidence, Petiot&#x2019;s brilliance and wit threatened to win the day.<br><br>Drawing extensively on many new sources, including the massive, classified French police file on Dr. Petiot, <i>Death in the City of Light</i> is a brilliant evocation of Nazi-Occupied Paris and a harrowing exploration of murder, betrayal, and evil of staggering proportions.</p><p><b>David King</b> is the New York Times best-selling author of <i>Death in the City of Light</i> and <i>Vienna 1814</i>.

How often has this phrase been uttered by someone with a heart full of anger or sorrow? Or as an invitation, a precursor to a declaration of love? Our species and its predecessors have been bipedal walkers for at least six million years; by now, we take this seemingly arbitrary motion for granted. Yet how many of us still really walk in our everyday lives? <br><br>Driven by a combination of a car-centric culture and an insatiable thirst for productivity and efficiency, we're spending more time sedentary and alone than we ever have before. If bipedal walking is truly what makes our species human, as paleoanthropologists claim, what does it mean that we are designing walking right out of our lives? Antonia Malchik asks essential questions at the center of humanity's evolution and social structures: Who gets to walk, and where? How did we lose the right to walk, and what implications does that have for the strength of our communities, the future of democracy, and the pervasive loneliness of individual lives? <br><br>The loss of walking as an individual and a community act has the potential to destroy our deepest spiritual connections, our democratic society, our neighborhoods, and our freedom. But we can change the course of our mobility. And we need to. Delving into a wealth of science, history, and anecdote -- from our deepest origins as hominins to our first steps as babies, to universal design and social infrastructure, <i>A Walking Life </i>shows exactly how walking is essential, and how deeply reliant our brains and bodies are on this simple pedestrian act -- and how we can reclaim it. <br></p><p><b>Antonia Malchik</b> is the managing editor of <i>STIR Journal</i> and a regular contributor to <i>Full Grown People</i>. Her essays and articles have appeared in <i>Aeon</i>, the <i>Washington Post</i>, the <i>Boston Globe</i>, the <i>Atlantic</i>, BuzzFeed Ideas, and many others. Formerly, she worked as a journalist in Austria and Australia. She lives in Northwest Montana with her family.<br><br>"Reading this wise, soulful book by Antonia Malchik feels like treating your�self to a good walk. By the end, you're thinking more clearly, you've had some unexpected insights, and you're really glad you took the time to do it."&#x2015;<b><i>Alan Weisman, author of the <i>New York Times </i>bestseller <i>The World Without Us</i> and <i>Countdown</i> <br></i></b><br><br>"Antonia Malchik's walkabout reconnects us to what it means to be human -- finding community, citizenship, creativity, mental and physical health, and ultimately, freedom -- through the perambulation that distinguishes us from other creatures. This is an important book for our time: we must reincorporate walking in the fabric of our environments if we are to remain resilient to the challenges that face us."&#x2015;<b><i>Wade Graham, author of <i>Dream Cities: Seven Urban Ideas That Shape the World </i><br></i></b><br><br>"This charming and poignant book really brings home what it means to walk. Look no further for evidence of what we have forsaken by allowing so much of our country and planet to be reshaped, no longer around the human stride, but around the demands of a two-ton steel carapace that, for only 20 percent of our income, grants us obesity, asthma, daily carnage, unending traffic, and climate change."&#x2015;<b><i>Jeff Speck, city planner and author <i>Walkable City Rules </i><br></i></b><br><br>"The overall message is eye-opening, revealing the somber reality of our car-centric world but also inspiring a desire to reconnect with our primeval desire to wander on our own two feet."<br>&#x2015;<b><i><i>Booklist</i></i></b><br><br>"Readers interested in green living and libraries that support ecology and urban studies programs will want this far-reaching book about how to maintain a sustainable lifestyle."&#x2015;<b><i><i>Library Journal</i><br><br></i></b><br><br>"A travel writer who now lives in her native Montana after decades of more urban life, Malchik hasn't simply written a self-help book on the physical and psychological benefits of walking, though there is plenty of that here. The author also delivers a manifesto that involves urban planning, technology, political protest, the environment, and the future of the planet. Humans were not only designed to walk, she writes; they are all but defined by their bipedal nature. [...] She also explores the ramifications of refugees walking hundreds of miles for asylum, protestors mobilizing in the thousands for political action, and pilgrims undertaking long journeys by foot for spiritual reasons. (She finds walking meditation more beneficial than sitting meditation.) If we walked more often, we'd feel better, think more creatively, suffer less depression, have more connections as a community, breathe cleaner air, and have a more profound understanding of our place on the planet...[Malchik] makes a convincing plea for better balance." <br>&#x2015;<b><i><i>Kirkus</i></i></b></p><h2>Dear Ally, How Do You Write a Book?</h2><p><b>From bestselling author Ally Carter, the definitive guide to writing a novel for the NaNoWriMo generation, including helpful tips from other YA stars.</b><br><br>Have you always wanted to write a book, but don't know where to start?

Since World War II, Germany has been viewed as the primary culprit. Now, in a major reinterpretation of the conflict, Sean McMeekin rejects the standard notions of the war&#x2019;s beginning as either a Germano-Austrian preemptive strike or a &#x201c;tragedy of miscalculation.&#x201d; Instead, he proposes that the key to the outbreak of violence lies in St. Petersburg.</p><p>It was Russian statesmen who unleashed the war through conscious policy decisions based on imperial ambitions in the Near East. Unlike their civilian counterparts in Berlin, who would have preferred to localize the Austro-Serbian conflict, Russian leaders desired a more general war so long as British participation was assured. The war of 1914 was launched at a propitious moment for harnessing the might of Britain and France to neutralize the German threat to Russia&#x2019;s goal: partitioning the Ottoman Empire to ensure control of the Straits between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean.</p><p>Nearly a century has passed since the guns fell silent on the western front. But in the lands of the former Ottoman Empire, World War I smolders still. Sunnis and Shiites, Arabs and Jews, and other regional antagonists continue fighting over the last scraps of the Ottoman inheritance. As we seek to make sense of these conflicts, McMeekin&#x2019;s powerful expos� of Russia&#x2019;s aims in the First World War will illuminate our understanding of the twentieth century.</p></p><p>Sean McMeekin is Assistant Professor of History at Ko� University in Istanbul, Turkey.&#x201c;This book should forever change the ways we have understood the role of Russia in the First World War.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Michael S.

Maneuvering France and England into a war against Germany presented the best chance to acquire this longed-for prize. No empire had more to gain from the coming conflict, and none pushed harder to ensure its arrival.

Set in South India during the British colonial period but with powerful resonance to the present day, <i>One Part Woman</i> tells the story of a couple, Kali and Ponna, who are unable to conceive, much to the concern of their families&#x2015;and the crowing amusement of Kali&#x2019;s male friends. Kali and Ponna try anything to have a child, including making offerings at different temples, atoning for past misdeeds of dead family members, and even circumambulating a mountain supposed to cure barren women, but all to no avail.<br><br>A more radical plan is required, and the annual chariot festival, a celebration of the god Maadhorubaagan, who is one part woman, one part man, may provide the answer. On the eighteenth night of the festival, the festivities culminate in a carnival, and on that night the rules of marriage are suspended, and consensual sex between any man and woman is permitted. The festival may be the solution to Kali and Ponna&#x2019;s problem, but it soon threatens to drive the couple apart as much as to bring them together. Wryly amusing, fable-like, and deeply poignant, <i>One Part Woman</i> is a powerful exploration of a loving marriage strained by the expectations of others, and an attack on the rigid rules of caste and tradition that continue to constrict opportunity and happiness today.</p><p><b>Perumal Murugan</b> is the star of contemporary Tamil literature. He has written ten novels and five collections each of short stories and poetry. His best-known novel <i>One Part Woman</i> won the prestigious ILF Samanvay Bhasha Samman for writing in Indian languages and, for this translation, the Translation Prize from India&#x2019;s National Academy of Letters.<b>Praise for <i>One Part Woman</i>:</b><p> <b>LONGLISTED FOR THE NATIONAL BOOK AWARD IN TRANSLATED LITERATURE</b></p><p> &#x201c;Murugan works his themes with a light hand; they always emanate from his characters, who are endowed with enough contradiction and mystery to keep from devolving into mouthpieces . . .

But faith is not equivalent to mere belief. Faith is the condition of ultimate confidence that we have the capacity to follow the path of doubt to its end. And courage.&#x201d;<br><br>In this engaging spiritual memoir, Stephen Batchelor describes his own training, first as a Tibetan Buddhist and then as a Zen practitioner, and his own direct struggles along his path. It is most uncanny that we are able to ask questions, for to question means to acknowledge that we do not know something. But it is more than an acknowledgement: it includes a yearning to confront an unknown and illuminate it through understanding. Questioning is a quest.&#x201d;<br><br>Batchelor is a contemporary Buddhist teacher and writer, best known for his secular or agnostic approach to Buddhism. He considers Buddhism to be a constantly evolving culture of awakening rather than a religious system based on immutable dogmas and beliefs. Buddhism has survived for the past 2,500 years because of its capacity to reinvent itself in accord with the needs of the different Asian societies with which it has creatively interacted throughout its history. As Buddhism encounters modernity, it enters a vital new phase of its development. Through his writings, translations and teaching, Stephen engages in a critical exploration of Buddhism's role in the modern world, which has earned him both condemnation as a heretic and praise as a reformer.<br></p><p><b>Stephen Batchelor</b> was born in Scotland, in 1953. He grew up in a humanist environment with his mother and brother in Watford, north west of London. After completing his education at Watford Grammar School, he travelled overland to India in 1972, at the age of eighteen. He settled in Dharamsala, the capital-in-exile of the Dalai Lama, and studied at the Library of Tibetan Works and Archives. He was ordained as a novice Buddhist monk in 1974. In April 1981 he travelled to Songgwangsa Monastery in South Korea to train in Zen Buddhism under the guidance of Ven. Kusan Sunim. He remained in Korea until the autumn of 1984, when he left for a pilgrimage to Japan, China and Tibet. He is the author of several books including<i>Alone With Others</i>, <i>The Awakening of the West</i>, and <i>Buddhism Without Beliefs</i>. His latest book,<i>Confessions of a Buddhist Atheist</i>, was published in 2010.<br><br>Doubt is central to the spiritual crisis many people find themselves in today. The beliefs of traditional religion having been undermined, it is often doubt we experience as the core of our spiritual awareness. Such doubt is not merely uncertainty about the claims of a particular spiritual tradition, but doubt about what is the meaning of our existence in this world. IT is precisely this kind of doubt that Zen takes up and channels towards awakening. Just as in India and Tibet desire and other kleshas were transformed into the path, so in Zen doubt is transformed into the path. The energetic power of what is conventionally conceived as an obstacle, a defilement or delusion, is thus used as a vehicle for freedom and illumination.<br>The Zen tradition often speaks of three factors that need to be cultivated along the path: great faith, great doubt, and great courage. Thus faith and doubt are brought together. Clearly, doubt in this context does not refer to the kind of wavering indecision in which we get stuck, preventing any positive movement. It means to keep alive the perplexity at the heart of our life, to acknowledge the fundamentally we do no know what is going on, to question whatever arises within us. The acceptance of such doubt as basic to Buddhist practice qualifies the meaning of faith. Faith is not the equivalent to mere belief. Faith is the condition of ultimate confidence that we have the capacity to follow the path of doubt to its end. And courage: courage is the strength needed to be true to ourselves under all conditions, to cast aside the obstacles that are constantly thrown our way.<br></p><h2>Hikaru no Go, Vol. 10 (10)</h2><p>The main round of the pro test has begun.

Walking among the trees and vines, he imagines the forest as it might have been in the past, with now-extinct creatures and aboriginal children inhabiting it. How much longer, the boy wonders, will the forest remain? Baker's portrayal of unspoiled nature is both an eloquent plea for conservation and a visual tour de force. Her collage constructions have the life and intensity of photographs; at the same time, they embody the inscrutable magic and spirit of a primeval forest. Dinosaurs emerge, barely perceptible, from a tangle of trunks and vines; the faint outlines of an aboriginal child melt into a background of trees; and, in the final, haunting scene, the unspoiled vista readers have toured is overlaid with translucent images of civilization's worst trappings.

These essays, comprising "How Little I Know," "Complexion 1976," "What I Am Trying to Do," "A Definition of Evolution," "'And It Came to Pass' (Not to Stay)," "Soft Revolution" and "Ethics," pursue the task of ushering in a new era for humanity by "always starting with the universe." Each of the texts is written in Fuller's "ventilated prose," an essayistic poem form that breaks up his thinking into lines and stanzas.Though best known as a designer and design theorist, Fuller investigated and challenged assumptions about structure, function, materials, technology, aesthetics, services, distribution, mobility, communication, collaboration, information, recycling, politics, property and social norms. These essays present the great range and depth of Fuller's thought while elegantly weaving the personal, the playful, the simple and the profound.</p></p><p></p><h2>The Functions of Social Conflict: An Examination of the Concept of Social Conflict and Its Use in Empirical Sociological Research</h2><p>For New condition books in our store; You will be the first user.

A&nbsp;<i>very</i>&nbsp;fussy eater. She won't eat her carrots (until big brother Charlie reveals that they are really orange twiglets from Jupiter). She won't eat her mashed potatoes (until Charlie explains they are cloud fluff from the pointiest peak of Mount Fuji). There are many, many things Lola absolutely will not eat, including &#x2014; and especially &#x2014; tomatoes. Or will she?<br><br>Join two endearing siblings for a smorgasbord of fun in Lauren Child's witty story about the triumph of imagination over proclivity.</p><p>Lola is a very fussy eater. Carrots are for rabbits and peas are "too small and too green." One day, after rattling off her long list of despised foods, she ends with the vehement pronouncement, "And I absolutely will never not ever eat a tomato." Not convinced, Lola's older sister Charlie has an idea. She tells Lola that the orange things on the table are not carrots, but "orange twiglets from Jupiter" and peas are in fact "green drops from Greenland." Mashed potatoes, when pitched as "cloud fluff from the pointiest peak of Mount Fuji" suddenly seem appealing to Lola. And in the end, might she even eat a tomato?<p> Lauren Child's wacky, expressive sketches of Lola and Charlie (much like those in <i>Clarice Bean, That's Me</i>) are cut out and superimposed on all sorts of textures and patterns from wallpaper to wood. Fuzzy, enlarged photographs of bowls of peas, or fish sticks, or big carrots are pasted right on top to great effect. This funny, endearing look at how children's tastes can be based more on preconception than taste buds is sure to infuse levity into the daily dinner-table struggle. The author's dedication?

Written as short monologues, each of these powerful, early works of autobiographical fiction is spoken in the voice of a character he stumbles upon during travels throughout America.<br></p><p>&#39;The Waterfront Journals&#39; is a collection of the author&#39;s early works of autobiographical fiction. Written as short monologues, each is in the voice of one of the many people he encountered in his travels throughout America in the late 1970s and early 1980s, when he was living on the street.The late performance artist (Close to the Knives: A Memoir of Disintegration, not reviewed), made famous by Jesse Helms, left these 40-plus short monologues--all of them written before his work became focused on his struggle with AIDS. Despite the argument advanced by Tony Kushner's politically hysterical introduction, these voices from the dark side needn't be ``authentic'' to have value as literature. Their similarity in syntax and design in fact suggest the controlling medium of Wojnarowicz, who romanticizes the down and out: the boy hustlers, junkies, alcoholics, crazies, whores, truckers, and hobos who relate their anecdotes of infamy in these relentlessly seedy narratives. The sex is mostly gay and anonymous. One man finds purity in such encounters by the Hudson River; another describes sex with a legless Vietnam vet; yet another takes advantage of a sick teenager who had previously resisted anal sex; a runner meets two drug-taking priests who talk about the size of various men they've had; a boy fades in and out of consciousness as he's being brutally raped by a sadist; another boy entertains a masochist; and a fellow describes the joys of naked boxing. The boys ``hustlin the Square'' describe the changes in Times Square johns; the whores tell of violent customers and corrupt cops. Winos and junkies, meanwhile, babble about all sorts of things, and a night watchman records his sad marital history. Truckers remember the golden age of hoboes, and a hobo talks of using trickery to commit his wife to an insane asylum. Many of these figures spin swift tales of deceit and deception, such as the boy who discovers that his movie-balcony pick-up is really a pre-op transsexual. Little attention is paid to place in these quick takes, and the speakers don't have much time to develop individuality, creating a certain flattening effect overall. If Studs Terkel covered the Jean Genet beat, the result might be something like these oral snippets, more sad than shocking. -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP.

It's like some crazy surgeon throws you on an operating table and removes a major organ from your chest called summer. He doesn't realize how much a kid <i>needs</i> that organ, as much as a liver or a spleen.I feel almost bruised being back at school, and I haven't even made itto class yet. Maybe if I go to the nurse, she'll take pity on me and hook me up to an emergency life support system. But before I can make any last wishes, my friend Matt punches me in the arm and jolts me back from my daytime nightmare."This year definitely won't be as bad as the others." Matt realizes the price tag is hanging from the sleeve of his shirt so he yanks it off as we talk.When we found out we would have Mr. Maroni this year, Matt and I were <i>almost</i> excited about school."It'll be great to finally have a guy teacher--I've never had one." I imagine a school filled with male teachers, couches, potato chips, and flat-screen TVs.Matt shakes me from my reverieby making a buzzing noise like they use on game shows to get rid of a losing contestant. "They just announced that Mr. Maroni's father died two days ago, and Mr. Maroni is moving to Cincinnati to take care of his mother.""WHAT?" The first day of school is bad enough without getting hit with a massive curveball while you're still at your locker."Want to know who we have instead?" Matt asks.I can't even begin to guess who'll be the master of my universe this year."Ms. McCuddles."It's not that I dislike Ms. McCoddle--she's nice, young, and has super-blond hair--but Matt and I had her way back in kindergarten,and even though we're totally grown up now, she still thinks of us as kids. It was fine when we were five and she told us to call her Ms. McCuddles and hugged us when we fell during recess, but now we're almost embarrassed when we see her in the hall.I try to analyze our new situation. "Option one--Ms. McCoddle is easy on us since she's used to dealing with little kids, and we won't have to plug in our brains all year."Matt offers a different opinion. "Option two--she tries to make up for being a kindergarten teacher by being super hard on us.""The one year we're supposed to get a guy teacher--figures something would happen to mess it up."Our worst fears are realized when Ms. McCoddle walks by. "Derek! Matt! Did you hear the good news?"We look down at our sneakers and nod."I'm setting up the mats and juice boxes now. Want to help?"Matt and I stare at her like she's just asked us to run over the principal with our skateboards.Ms. McCoddle laughs so hard, she snorts. "I'm kidding! We're starting right in on the Civil War. Get ready for some fierce discussion."We watch her walk down the hall with a feeling of dread."Option two is officially in effect," Matt says.I barely hear him because I'm halfway down the hall, looking for the janitor, hoping he'll agree to knock me on the head with a mallet to put me out of my misery.Henry Holt� is a registered trademark of Henry Holt and Company, LLC.

WHAT THE hell are you doing on the floor?&#x201d; my dorm roommate, Ellie Patton, asked. She stood in our bathroom doorway with her hands on her hips, gaping at me with her black pearl eyes so enlarged that she resembled someone with serious thyroid problems. I realized she must have been standing there for a while calling to me and was getting upset at my not responding.<br> <br>I was surprised she was up so early. Everything about her was usually frantic and last-minute. We had been together at Collier for my three years of private high school, but this was the first time she had caught me doing it.<br> <br>For the last three years, I woke up on the morning of my daughter&#x2019;s birthday and secretly lit a candle. I would hear my sister, Cassie, whispering in my ear, reminding me of the date as well, not that I needed her to do that. Lately, however, I was even seeing her stepping out of a shadow or smiling back at me in a mirror.<br> <br>Usually, I was home on my daughter&#x2019;s birthday because it occurred during a spring break. However, this year, the break occurred two days after her birthday, so I was still at Collier, a private high school for girls just south of Albany, New York.<br> <br>I hadn&#x2019;t expected to be sent to a private high school outside Kentucky, but Daddy had chosen Collier for me because it was so exclusive, which really meant very expensive and well supervised. My therapist in Kentucky, Dr. Ryan, had recommended it. It had a small but beautifully maintained campus. The main building was neoclassical and resembled a government office building, something you might expect to find in Washington, D.C. There were three dormitory buildings that looked like anything but dormitory buildings because of their elaborate landscaping and porticos. They looked more like private estates.<br> <br>Our dormitory housed only twenty girls, and none of our classes had more than fifteen students in it. Some of my public-school classes had had nearly forty in them. It was impossible here to avoid being called on to answer a question or have your homework checked. Every teacher was well acquainted with all of his or her students, their work histories, and their families. The story circulated was that they had reports on us that rivaled FBI reports on terror suspects.<br> <br>The school had a beautiful, technologically modern theater; two playfields, one for field hockey and one for softball; and a spanking-new gymnasium. The library was stocked with computers and had a separate audiovisual room for viewing information or listening to music. Our cafeteria reminded me of an upscale restaurant. The chairs were large and cushioned, and the tables were polished, rich, hard walnut.<br> <br>Once a month, the school held a formal dinner for us during which the dean of students, Mrs. Hathaway, delivered a report concerning the student body&#x2019;s overall performance and her expectations for the weeks to come. Attendance was mandatory. Every violation, whether of rules or of the property, was described, and the violators were sometimes publicly chastised. Contrary to what she hoped, however, making it onto what the students called Hathaway&#x2019;s Hit List was viewed as some sort of accomplishment, a respected act of defiance. I had yet to make the list.<br> <br>Few private schools gave their students as much personal attention, which meant there were more eyes on us all day and all night than in most other private schools. The restrictions on our comings and goings were also far stricter than at other schools. Our privileges were directly tied to our grades and our on-campus behavior, as at other schools, but at Collier, there was a hair trigger on punishment. It wouldn&#x2019;t take much to put one of us in a cage, and, of course, smoking, drinking alcohol, or doing any drugs were reasons for immediate expulsion and forfeiting all of the money your parents had spent, and they had spent a great deal.<br> <br>There was even a rumor that our rooms were bugged and our phone calls monitored. Supposedly, our parents received weekly reports about our behavior and our work. Some even thought it was a daily report. Most of the girls believed the rumors, because almost all of them had given their parents cause to worry about them. It was almost a requirement for admittance that we were not to be trusted or believed. The game played with incoming first-year girls was how quickly one of us could get them to reveal their embarrassing secrets, something that explained why their parents would want to pay so much more money for them to attend Collier.<br> <br>The secret I revealed was probably the most boring for them. Ellie told me I was one of the longest holdouts, one of the most difficult to break, because I wasn&#x2019;t as desperate for their friendship. Finally, I revealed that I had been seeing a therapist regularly because of family tragedies and there was concern that I could have a nervous breakdown. Or, as my father put it to Mrs. Hathaway, &#x201c;She&#x2019;s as fragile as a blue-jay egg.&#x201d;<br> <br>Of course, nothing was ever said about my pregnancy and my giving birth, but when some people my age hear that you have deep-seated psychological issues serious enough to require regular therapy and you&#x2019;re on the edge of falling into a nervous breakdown, they look at you as if you have leprosy. I felt confident, however, that many of the others had been sent for counseling at one time or another as well. One or two looked and acted as if they had recently been released from a clinic, in fact. But unlike me, they felt that secret was too sensitive to reveal. They probably invented something else or told only part of their story. Ironically, they&#x2019;d admit to getting pregnant and having an abortion before they&#x2019;d admit to having been in psychological counseling for years, but that was not true for me. The Cassie living inside me wouldn&#x2019;t let me do that.<br> <br>Even while I had attended my private high school, I&#x2019;d had periodic sessions with Dr. Ryan, when I was home for either an extended weekend or on holiday. It was really my father&#x2019;s younger brother, my uncle Perry, who insisted that my father arrange that in the first place.<br> <br>&#x201c;After all she has gone through, she has way too much emotional and psychological damage, Teddy,&#x201d; he told him right in front of me. &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t just send her off to live in an unfamiliar environment with strangers. She needs support, professional support, and we both know you&#x2019;re too busy to provide it.&#x201d;<br> <br>Of course, Uncle Perry had been right, and if it hadn&#x2019;t been for Dr. Ryan, I probably wouldn&#x2019;t have been this close to finishing high school, even one as insulated and protective as Collier. I certainly would never have had the strength to go off to college, not that I thought I would. I avoided filling out applications, but to satisfy my curious classmates, I pretended I had already been admitted to an expensive small college in Kentucky. They believed it. For the most part, everyone believed whatever I said because I said it with such conviction and nonchalance. I think that was because I made myself believe it first.<br> <br>Even though I didn&#x2019;t see a therapist on a regular basis here, I had many informal sessions with Mrs. Hathaway. She obviously knew when I had a long break between classes and either casually came by my room at the dormitory or caught me walking on campus and invited me to her office for a cup of tea.<br> <br>Her questions were always the same. &#x201c;How are you getting along with your roommate, your classmates, and your teachers? Why aren&#x2019;t you participating in any activities like the drama club, chorus, or one of the athletic teams? You&#x2019;ve got to expand your interests, explore, experiment, Semantha. Doesn&#x2019;t anything we offer interest you?&#x201d;<br> <br>Almost always, she&#x2019;d tilt her head and smile softly before asking, &#x201c;Have you met any nice boys at our social events?&#x201d;<br> <br>All of the girls thought little of Collier&#x2019;s social events. There were so many chaperones, and the security personnel hovered outside every entrance like killer bees ready to sting anyone for the smallest indiscretion. It was nearly impossible to go off and do something we considered more exciting. It was like being brought up in the mid-forties, when there were actually rules about how many inches apart a boy and a girl had to be when they danced together. And of course, if you wore anything Mrs. Hathaway considered inappropriate, you weren&#x2019;t even permitted to enter the auditorium for one of the official socials.<br> <br>In general, the boys we met at these highly controlled gatherings came from brother schools for boys or nearby parochial schools. On very rare occasions, boys from one of the area public schools were invited, but they were usually what Mrs. Hathaway would call the cr�me de la cr�me, the honor students. Davina Bernstein said they were rented from Geeks R Us and at midnight would turn into laptops.<br> <br>I told Mrs. Hathaway that I hadn&#x2019;t met any boy who remotely interested me or whom I interested. None of my answers to any of her questions really pleased her, but she wasn&#x2019;t pushy. Like most of the people my father had spoken to about me, she tiptoed and whispered and showed great patience and understanding. I was so tired of this so-called tender loving care that I wanted to scream, but instead, I turned myself into a sponge, absorbed what I had to absorb, and then squeezed it out of myself as soon as I was alone again or when Ellie was on the phone or out in the hallway talking to other girls.<br> <br>Right now, she continued to stand in the bathroom doorway, impatiently waiting for an explanation for the lit candle and my sitting cross-legged on the bathroom floor talking to myself.<br> <br>When I was at home on my daughter&#x2019;s birthday, I lit the candle in my bathroom with the windows wide open so no one would smell the wax melting. Softly, under my breath, I would sing &#x201c;Happy Birthday&#x201d; to her and pretend she was there, now almost four years old, sitting on the floor with me, her eyes wide with excitement. I even pretended to give her a present and watch her unwrap it. We would hug, and I would hold her and give her the security and comfort that came with knowing your mother is always there for you, loving you and protecting you. I cried tears of joy for both of us.<br> <br>Then I would hear someone walking in the hallway or a door open and close, and I would quickly smother the candle flame and hide the candle again in the bottom of a sink cabinet. I knew how furious my father would be if he discovered I had done such a thing. Maybe for a few seconds, there was some awareness of the special day visible in his eyes on the first-year anniversary after I had given birth, but that candle burning in his memory was soon snuffed out. It was truly as though he had clapped his hands over the tiny flame.<br> <br>I could never forget any of it, even though it was all so painful to remember. Of course, I tried to forget. I really did, and maybe I was making some progress. Maybe that was why Cassie was coming back to me in whisperings and shadows. She was afraid I would leave her in her grave forever.<br> <br>&#x201c;Semantha?&#x201d; Ellie pursued. &#x201c;Will you please tell me what you&#x2019;re doing in our bathroom?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s just something I do in memory of someone I loved and lost,&#x201d; I told her.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Sorry.&#x201d; I knew she thought I was doing it for my mother or my sister or perhaps both.<br> <br>When Ellie and I were first assigned to room with each other, I didn&#x2019;t reveal anything about my seeing a therapist on a regular basis. I did that later, when it was clear to me that none of the girls would leave me be until I told them something negative about myself. It was almost as if they wouldn&#x2019;t tolerate someone who had nothing to hide.<br> <br>However, I told Ellie the story that was so embedded in my mind that it was practically a recording. I couldn&#x2019;t avoid telling her, because I never had a mother call or visit, and the logical question was why not.<br> <br>&#x201c;My parents at a late time in their marriage tried to have another child, hoping for a boy,&#x201d; I began. &#x201c;My father had always dreamed of having a son he would name after one of his famous ancestors, Asa Heaven-stone, a young man who fought and was killed in the Civil War. His portrait hangs on a wall in our house in Kentucky with the portraits of other Heaven-stone ancestors.<br> <br>&#x201c;Not long after my sister and I were told that my mother was pregnant, it was determined that my mother was having a boy. The news brought my parents great happiness. They immediately began work on setting up the nursery, but my mother suffered a miscarriage and went into a deep depression. She took too many sleeping pills one day, and we lost her.&#x201d;<br> <br>Of course, I didn&#x2019;t tell Ellie about the things Cassie had done to cause all of this. Only my father, my uncle Perry, and I knew the truth.<br> <br>Ellie, like everyone else, looked devastated for me and nearly broke into tears.<br> <br>&#x201c;Less than two years later,&#x201d; I continued, &#x201c;my sister, Cassie, tripped and fell down a stairway in our house and broke her neck. She died instantly.&#x201d;<br> <br>When I added that, some people would just sit with their mouths wide open, and some would shake their heads and say, &#x201c;You poor girl and your poor, poor father.&#x201d;<br> <br>I would bear their sympathy like someone who had been beaten beyond pain and thank them.<br> <br>Ellie didn&#x2019;t linger after I explained the candle. She nodded, backed out of the bathroom, and closed the door. She either fled from or ignored sad news and stories of family tragedies. It was one of the reasons I could get along so well with her.<br> <br>I continued with my private birthday ritual and blew out the candle. Ellie never asked me anything else about it again, and, of course, I never mentioned it to her. I didn&#x2019;t like lying to her. I never liked lying to anyone, in fact, even though my sister, Cassie, had thought that was a weakness.<br> <br>&#x201c;There are very few people, Semantha, whom you can trust with the truth. The truth is naked, unprotected. Once it&#x2019;s out there, it&#x2019;s alone. Lying,&#x201d; she had said with that Cassie smirk I had grown used to seeing, &#x201c;is simply another layer of protective skin.&#x201d;<br> <br>I knew the other girls at Collier thought I was unusual in many ways, but my brutal honesty did the most to keep me from becoming very friendly with anyone else but Ellie. Despite what Cassie had told me about the value of lying, she had rarely bothered to do so even when it came to holding on to a friend. I had her way of simply telling other girls and boys whatever I really thought, no matter what the consequences. My quiet manner and my revelation about a potential nervous breakdown already had done much to create a deep, wide valley between me and the others at Collier. This characteristic of being coldly and factually honest at times was the icing on the cake. Even when I sat with them in the cafeteria or walked alongside them in the corridors, most avoided looking at me, and when anyone did, she usually turned away quickly. It was as if she was looking at something forbidden.<br> <br>From the way the others whispered and sometimes hovered with Ellie in corners, I knew they were peppering her with questions about me. They surely wondered what it was like sleeping in the same room with someone as weird as I was. I never asked Ellie about it, but occasionally, she would reveal some of their questions&#x2014;mostly, I think, because she was curious about the answers herself.<br> <br>Naturally, they wanted to know wha...</p><h2>The Liturgical Organist, Vol 2: Easy Compositions -- Preludes/Interludes/Postludes for Pipe or Reed Organ with Hammond Registrations</h2><p>This is the 2nd in a 4-book collection of preludes, interludes, and postludes compiled and arranged by Carlo Rossini for performance on pipe, electronic or reed organs, and with Hammond registrations included.

Mahamudra is only experience.&#x201d;<br> <br> He relies on the First Panchen Lama&#x2019;s well-known Root Text of Genden Mahamudra, which in a few short pages provides the pith instructions for, first, overcoming distraction and resting in meditative stillness on the clarity of one&#x2019;s own mind, and then, with subtle awareness, penetrating its ultimate nature, its emptiness.<br> <br> As always, Lama Yeshe&#x2019;s words are direct, funny, and incredibly encouraging. He gets us to go beyond ego&#x2019;s addiction to a limited sense of self and to taste the lightness and expansiveness of our own true nature.</p><p>Lama Thubten Yeshe (1935&#x2013;84) was born in Tibet and educated at the great Sera Monastic University. He fled the Chinese occupation of his country in 1959. In the late 1960s, with his chief disciple Lama Thubten Zopa Rinpoche, he began teaching Buddhism to Westerners at Kopan Monastery, Kathmandu, Nepal. In 1975 they founded the international Buddhist organization the Foundation for the Preservation of the Mahayana Tradition (FPMT), which now has more than 160 centers, projects, and services worldwide.<br> &nbsp;<br> <br>Ordained since the late 1970s, Ven. Robina Courtin has worked full time since then for Lama Thubten Yeshe and Lama Zopa Rinpoche&#x2019;s FPMT. Over the years she has served as editorial director of Wisdom Publications, editor of Mandala Magazine, executive director of Liberation Prison Project, and as a touring teacher of Buddhism. Her life and work have been featured in the documentary films Chasing Buddha and Key to Freedom."This is a beautiful book.&nbsp;It was Lama Yeshe&#x2019;s unique genius to be able to render difficult matters in simple, joyous, and encouraging language. In&nbsp;<i>Mahamudra: How to Discover Our True Nature</i>, he does that once again, offering us profound guidance about Mahamudra practice and the experience of emptiness as only someone with his deep meditative accomplishments and immense heart could do. How happy I am to hear his voice again here. Venerable Robina Courtin&#x2019;s remarkably skillful editing has done us all a great kindness. May we listen to these marvelous teachings in the way they were originally offered, with great joy and pleasure."<br> &nbsp; Author: Jan Willis, author of Dreaming Me: Black, Baptist and Buddhist&#x2015;One Woman&#x2019;s Spiritual Journey<br><br>"While the Gelug&nbsp;tradition generally emphasizes extensive study of Dharma followed by analytical meditation, in his classic teachings on Mahamudra, Panchen Lama Losang Chokyi Gyaltsen suggests first achieving shamatha and on that basis seeking the view of emptiness. Lama Thubten Yeshe provides in this volume a wonderfully lucid, inspiring explanation of this experiential way of exploring the true nature of the mind, for which the achievement of samadhi is an indispensable prerequisite. Indeed, as he declares, 'Without perfect samadhi, then, there is no way to become liberated from samsara and no way to achieve enlightenment.'&nbsp;This is a clarion call for all those, Buddhist and otherwise, who are seeking a path of spiritual awakening." Author: B. Alan Wallace, President of the Santa Barbara Institute for Consciousness Studies<br><br>"When I first heard Lama Yeshe speak in 1973, I thought that the place had been struck by an earthquake. He was one of those rare masters who had that kind of power in his presence. He also had the rare talent of being able to teach the most profound aspects of the enlightenment tradition with a most direct and simple language, drawing students into an immediate experience. This small book on Mahamudra, a transmission often referred to as 'the highest teachings of the Buddha,'&nbsp;very wonderfully captures that direct power of the living enlightenment transmission."

Lymphedema can be caused by burns, injury, surgery, radiation therapy, obesity, or circulatory problems. Many breast- and prostate-cancer survivors have, or risk developing, lymphedema. There is also an inherited form. If not treated, lymphedema can be painful and lead to life-threatening infections. This book will help you live well with lymphedema through treatment, self-management, and helpful tips for daily living. It will also help you understand how the lymphatic system works, how lymphedema is diagnosed, how to cope with the emotional challenges of lymphedema, how to find treatment, and deal with insurance issues. Living Well is for those with, or at risk for, lymphedema as well as healthcare professionals, caregivers, and friends and family.</p><p><b>Living Well With Lymphedema</b> is the comprehensive resource for those with, or at risk of developing, lymphedema. This easy-to-read, generously illustrated, 280 page book contains the information necessary to understand what is lymphedema, what causes it, how it is treated, self-management steps to control your condition, practical suggestions on how to master the emotional challenges that accompany living with a chronic condition, plus an illustrated guide to understanding the lymphatic system. </p> <p>LymphNotes.com, the highly respected lymphedema oriented website, provides insights into the needs and interests of hundreds of individuals with, at risk of, or caring for someone with lymphedema.</p></p><p><p>From the preface: </p><p><b>The Epidemic No One Talks About</b><br> Now that cancer has become a chronic condition, we face a stealth epidemic of lymphedema among cancer survivors. Many physicians don&#x2019;t recognize lymphedema and some deny that it happens&#x2014;but there it is in all of its swollen glory. That is the gloomy side of the picture. </p><p>The bright side of the picture is that the situation is changing! Physicians and other healthcare providers are becoming more aware of lymphedema and promising research on lymphedema prevention and treatment is underway. Most importantly there is a growing&#x2014;but still not large enough&#x2014;pool of specialized therapists who treat lymphedema and improve the quality of life for their patients. </p><p>Another change for the better is that patients are taking a more active role in the management of their own healthcare. These patients ask questions and search for answers. They want to know! Many also support each other by swapping tips on what works, or doesn&#x2019;t work, or just by listening through the tough times that come from living with a chronic condition. </p><p>Our goal is to provide practical information in a format that is easy-to-understand for people with lymphedema, friends and family, and healthcare professionals. We hope that we will be able to help you live well with lymphedema.</p><p><b>Advanced praise for Living Well With Lymphedema:</b> </p><p>"This book is very well organized and thought out, providing enough detail, explanation, and practical insight to enable someone with lymphedema to live safely and well.

Patterson to oversee the construction of a railway bridge over the Tsavo River in present-day Kenya. Almost immediately after his arrival, lion attacks started to take place on the workers, with the lions dragging men out of their tents at night and feeding on their victims. Despite taking various measures to curb the attacks, they escalated dramatically, and eventually the bridge construction stopped due to a mass exodus of the workers. The superstitious workers became increasingly hostile and many of them were certain that the lions were evil spirits who came to punish the bridge builders. With his reputation, livelihood and personal safety at stake, Patterson realized that he had to deal with the crisis in the only way he knew how - hunt the man-eaters down and kill them. This true story was the basis for 3 films; The Ghost and the Darkness (1996), starring Val Kilmer as Patterson, being the latest.</p><p>Colonel John Henry Patterson (1865-1947) was an Anglo-Irish soldier, hunter, and author.

Mark Mazower forces us to set aside timeworn opinions of the Third Reich, and instead shows how the party drew inspiration for its imperial expansion from America and Great Britain. Yet the Nazis? lack of political sophistication left them unequal to the task of ruling what their armies had conquered, despite a shocking level of cooperation from the overwhelmed countries. A work as authoritative as it is unique, <i>Hitler?s Empire</i> is a surprising?and controversial? new appraisal of the Third Reich?s rise and ultimate fall.</p><p><b>Mark Mazower</b>&nbsp;is the Ira D. Wallach Professor of History at Columbia University. He is the author of&nbsp;<i>Hitler&#x2019;s Empire</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>The Balkans: A Short History</i>, winner of the Wolfson Prize for History, among other books. He lives in New York City.From The Washington Post's Book World/washingtonpost.com Reviewed by Andrew Nagorski Surveying Nazi Germany's conquests shortly after it invaded the Soviet Union, Hitler's minister of economics boasted: "Never before in the history of the world has there been such an economy to administer." Germany was indeed the master of most of Europe at that point, and its armies were marching quickly into Russia. But in Hitler's Empire, Columbia University historian Mark Mazower spells out how ill-prepared the Germans were for their string of early victories -- and how completely they botched the administration of their empire. Many histories have focused on Hitler's costly military mistakes, particularly on the Eastern Front. Mazower largely ignores the battlefields and focuses instead on the political, racial and economic policies of the Nazi conquerors. While many parts of this story have been told before, he painstakingly examines a huge body of evidence for insights into Nazi misrule. This hardly makes for light reading, but it allows him to present a compelling case, which was best summarized by a German general at the end of the war. Addressing his fellow POWs, Ferdinand Heim argued that the German war effort would have been doomed "even if no military mistakes had been made." The reason: Nazi articles of faith amounted to grotesque fantasies about how the New Order would function, and they couldn't possibly survive prolonged, or even relatively short, clashes with reality. Leaving morality aside, the Holocaust made no economic sense at a time when Germany was desperately short of workers. When Victor Brack, one of the officials charged with carrying out the Final Solution, suggested that between 2 and 3 million Jews could be sterilized and put to work rather than killed, Hitler wasn't interested. The German leader's plans for the rest of the people in the East were even more absurd in economic terms, since they involved the majority of the local inhabitants, not just minorities. Under Nazi doctrine, Germanization was the overarching goal, which meant eliminating as many non-Germans as possible and finding and elevating local Germans or bringing in new German settlers. But after Germany and the Soviet Union invaded Poland in 1939, 90 percent of the inhabitants of German-occupied territory were Poles and only 6 percent ethnic Germans. And as the empire grew, the proportions of ethnic Germans became even smaller. In the midst of a widening conflict, German officials methodically photographed and examined Polish families, discriminating in favor of those who appeared to have "the soundest German blood." All of which was guaranteed to stir resentment. Even Colonel-General Johannes von Blaskowitz, one of the German commanders in Poland, noted: "The idea that one can intimidate the Polish population by terrorism and rub their noses in the dirt will certainly prove false." Nowhere was that miscalculation more costly than in the Soviet Union. After Stalin's purges and forced collectivization of the 1930s, some Ukrainians, Lithuanians and even Russians were prepared to view any invaders as possible saviors. Hitler's ruthless policies, directed not just against Jews but also against Soviet POWs and the entire civilian population, quickly disabused them of such notions. That part of the story is fairly well-known. But Mazower goes one step further by demonstrating the hypothetical alternative. He points to the relatively enlightened occupation of southern Ukraine and Odessa. In the port city, locals could open businesses if they offered the right bribes, and visiting Germans were astonished by the thriving shops, restaurants and cafes -- all with plenty of food. "It simply showed what could have happened across the former Soviet territories," Mazower writes, "if the Germans had allowed markets to flourish and not planned to destroy the social order." Ironically, the industrialized economies of Western Europe, where German rule was far less draconian than in the East, contributed more to the German war effort than the Eastern territories did. By deliberately starving their Eastern subjects, the Germans only contributed to the poor performance of the agricultural sector. And yet it was the East that mesmerized Hitler, whose whole notion of Lebensraum was built on the premise that Germany would harvest great riches there, using largely mythic German settlers. There simply weren't anywhere near the number of Germans needed to transform those fantasies into reality. At times, Mazower's sweeping survey feels forced, trying to cover everything -- the origins of Nazism, the Holocaust, collaboration and resistance in all parts of occupied Europe. Inevitably, there are some questionable generalizations. In explaining the Nazi New Order, Mazower asserts, "the quest to unify Germans within a single German state" was more important than anti-Semitism or than the lust for conquest -- as if these are contradictory impulses. But all the way through, Mazower offers incisive details and insights that make Hitler's Empire a fascinating read. He points out, for example, that the United States accounted for 67 percent of the world's oil output in 1943 and the Soviet Union only 10 percent. So here, too, Hitler's basic assumptions about what he would gain by conquering the East were flawed: Even if his armies had taken the oil fields in the Caucasus, he wouldn't have solved his energy problem. Luckily for Germany's opponents, the master race was totally impervious to something as mundane as logic. <br>Copyright 2008, The Washington Post.

It feels like a secret treasure bequeathed by Stephen Levine to be opened after his death&#x2015;an overflowing vessel of insight, humor and literary genius. <i>Animal Sutras</i> may be the best book Stephen Levine ever wrote.&#x201d; &#x2015;Mirabai Starr, <i>Wild Mercy</i></p> <p>&#x201c;Stephen was a profound healer of the heart, writer and meditation teacher.

So, at age seventy, he began collecting animal spirit stories and transcendent moments in nature from throughout his life&#x2015;from the green snake who taught him to meditate as a boy to the generous hen whom predators would not harm, and many more. &#x201c;Animals have a natural mindfulness,&#x201d; Levine writes. &#x201c;They know what they are doing. Humans, who are full of confusion and seldom wholly in touch with their mind/body, need encouragement and technique to live in the present.&#x201d;</p> <p><b>Stephen Levine</b> (1937&#x2013;2016) was an American poet, author, and spiritual teacher best known for his work, with his wife Ondrea, on death and dying. He is one of a generation of pioneering teachers who made Theravada Buddhism more widely available to students in the West. Like the writings of his colleague and close friend Ram Dass (formerly Richard Alpert), Levine&#x2019;s work is also flavored by the devotional practices and teachings of the Hindu guru Neem Karoli Baba. Levine spent many years in the Southwest, including one tending a wildlife sanctuary in southern Arizona, and among the mountains of New Mexico, where Ondrea still lives. His many books include <i>Who Dies?</i>, <i>A Year to Live</i>, <i>Unattended Sorrow</i>, and <i>Healing into Life and Death</i>.</p></p><p><p>Poet, dharma teacher, and companion to the dying and the bereaved, Stephen Levine embodied his own exhortation to &#x201c;keep your heart open in hell.&#x201d; Born in 1937 to a secular Jewish family, Stephen spent his adult life exploring, practicing, and sharing the traditions of the East, weaving a tapestry of seemingly disparate but ultimately harmonious elements of bhakti yoga (the Hindu path of devotion) and Vipassana (Buddhist mindfulness practice). He died in 2016 in the home he shared with his beloved wife and co-teacher, Ondrea, in the mountains of northern New Mexico.</p> <p>A longtime friend of iconic spiritual teacher Ram Dass, and of the pioneer of the conscious dying movement Elizabeth Kubler-Ross, Stephen shifted the cultural conversation around death. By embracing both dying and grieving as opportunities for awakening, Stephen and Ondrea helped countless beings approach their own deaths as the ultimate spiritual experience and their bereaved loved ones to be blessed with transformation. Among Stephen&#x2019;s many books, <i>Who Dies?</i>, <i>Unattended Sorrow</i>, and <i>One Year to Live</i> endure as classics and continue to serve as vital guides to those seeking support for navigating the mystery of the human condition.</p> <p>In their work with both the dying and the living, Stephen and Ondrea reclaimed the concept of &#x201c;mercy&#x201d; as an essential element in self-forgiveness, enabling people on a conscious path to leave this world unburdened by guilt, and to dispel the legacy of shame in the hearts of those left behind. These teachings, though simple, were revolutionary. Stephen&#x2019;s book <i>Becoming Kwan Yin</i> draws on the Chinese Buddhist bodhisattva of compassion as an exemplar for this liberating practice.</p> <p>For several decades, Stephen and Ondrea lived in relative isolation in the high desert of rural New Mexico (where Ondrea continues to live), raising children and animals, in close connection with the land. Their solitary life in the wilderness made their outpouring of loving attention to the dying and the bereaved possible. One of Stephen&#x2019;s lesser-known passions was his deep connection with animals, both domestic and wild. A consummate storyteller, Stephen conveyed his relationships with dogs and horses, his encounters with snakes and skunks, and his visitations by mockingbirds and hummingbirds with the artfulness of a bard and the insight of a Buddha. </p><br><br><p>Dr. Joanne Cacciatore, author of <i>Animal Sutras</i>&#x2019; foreword, is the founder of the MISS Foundation and is currently a professor at Arizona State University.

Stephen Levine has called upon the Muse of Story to distill into words his many encounters with animals, and how the meeting of these shared consciounesses has illuminated and guided the instincts and attitudes of his heart. In the spirit of Ovid and Aesop, the J&#x101;takas and La Fontaine, but informed by living truths transmitted by nature rather than imagined myths and fables, he shares with us how these meetings have repeatedly led him to the Sacred.</p> <p>"Whether it is forgiveness from a salamander, stillness from a green snake, the acknowledgement of territories by a spider or mindfulness by ravens, over and over these stories lead us, too, to realize the primacy of kindness as the way for all of us to help each other to arrive at wellbeing. Ajahn Chah used to say, 'Everything is teaching us, if we let it.' This slender volume carries that exact same message. The lesson might be sweet, like the results of practicing patience in caring for a sick cat, or it might be bitter, like the witnessing of a weeping bull before an impassioned crowd&#x2015;either way, how much better our world will be if we allow the animals of our own nature to learn from the life that is all around us."&#x2015;<b>Ajahn Amaro</b>, Amaravati Buddhist Monastery </p> <p>&#x201c;A beautifully wise and whimsical book that brings us back into our hearts and connects us with the everything. Many authors talk about mindfulness, but we are left unaffected. Stephen has a magical way of bringing us into the experience itself. Even from the beyond, he calls us home to ourselves. As I read his poignant stories, I was reminded of what really mattered. I am grateful for this brilliant offering.&#x201d;&#x2015;<b>Jeff Brown</b>, author of <i>Soulshaping</i> and <i>Grounded Spirituality</i></p> <p>&#x201c;Stephen&#x2019;s generosity of spirit and depth of compassion shine forth.

Spiritual teacher Eckart Tolle says, 'I have lived with several Zen masters&#x2015;all of them cats.' French writer Milan Kundra says, 'Dogs are our link to Paradise. They don't know evil or jealousy or discontent.' Jewish philosopher Martin Buber wrote: 'An animal's eyes have the power to speak a great language.' These words all ring true to me, as the animals in my own life have been wise teachers, loyal companions, and loving friends. I know what Stephen Levine means when he talks about his 'life becoming truer due to the interchange with plants and animals, mercy and awareness.' Mine, too.

In this brilliant and highly readable new history Touraj Daryaee fills a huge gap in our knowledge of world history.He examines the Sasanians'complex and colourful narrative and demonstrates their unique significance,not only for the development of Iranian civilisation but also for Roman and Islamic history. The Sasanians were the last of the ancient Persian dynasties and are best known as the preeminent practitioners of the Zoroastrian religion.From its foundation by Ardashir I in 224 CE, the Sasanian Empire was the dominant force in the Middle East for several centuries until its last king, Yazdgerd III, was defeated by the Muslim Arabs,whose horsemen swept away his seemingly far more powerful empire in the 7th century.Theirs was the first post Hellenic civilisation in the Near East to operate on an imperial scale and its sphere of influence and contact was unparalleled-from India to the Levant and from the Arabian Peninsula to the Caspian Sea.<br>In this concise yet comprehensive new book,Touraj Daryaee provides an unrivalled account of Sasanian Persia.Drawing on extensive new sources he paints a vivid portrait of Sasanian life and unravels the divergent strands that contributed to the making of this great Empire:religion-not just Zoroastrianism but also Manichaeaism;the economy;administration;the multiple languages and their literature as well as the Empire's often neglected social history. Daryaee also explores - for the first time in an integrated book on the Sasanians-their descendants'attempts for more than a century after their defeat to establish a second state and reveals how their values and traditions have endured,both in Iranian popular culture and in the literary tradition of the Persian language and literature,to the present day. Sasanian Persia is a unique examination of a period of history that still has great significance for a full understanding of modern Iran.</p></p><p>Touraj Daryaee is Howard Baskerville Professor in the history of Iran and the Persianate World and Associate Director of the Dr. Samuel M. Jordan Center for Persian Studies at the University of California, Irvine. He works on the history of ancient and early medieval Iran and is the editor of the International Journal of Ancient Iranian Studies.""Touraj Daryaee synthesizes a new generation of Sasanian scholarship to present the first single volume study of such important history - important not only for understanding Iranian, but Roman and early Islamic histories as well. The author's erudition is very impressive and he masters complex sources with exemplary clarity."" &#x2013; Gene Garthwaite, Professor of History and Jane and Raphael Bernstein Professor of Asian Studies, Dartmouth College, New Hampshire<br><br>""Touraj Daryaee is a well-known scholar of Sasanian history and religious texts who knows the subject well and has published widely in his field.

He and the neurobiolgist Giulio Tononi show how they use ingenious technology to detect the most minute brain currents and to identify the specific brain waves that correlate with particular conscious experiences. The results of this pioneering work challenge the conventional wisdom about consciousness.</p><p>Emily Dickinson wrote "The Brain--is wider than the Sky," and who can argue with that? Quoted by Nobel-winning scientist Gerald M. Edelman and his Neurosciences Institute colleague Giulio Tononi in <i>A Universe of Consciousness</i>, Miss Emily neatly explains the problem of conscious awareness, then ducks out of the way as the two scientists get to work solving it. Testable theories of consciousness are mighty lonely, as even the soberest mind can be driven to tears of madness pondering its own activity. Centuries of work by philosophers and psychologists like James and Freud have made little progress by starting with awareness and working backward to the brain; these days we have a secure enough base to try looking in the other direction and building a theory of the mind out of neurons.<p> Though Edelman and Tononi do make a good effort to help out the lay reader, ultimately <i>A Universe of Consciousness</i> is aimed at the interdisciplinary gang of scientists and academics trying to understand our shared but invisible experience. The first sections of the book cover the basic philosophical, psychological, and biological elements essential to their theory. Swiftly the authors proceed to define terms and concepts (even the long-abused term <i>complexity</i> gets a reappraisal) and elaborate on these to create a robust, testable theory of the neural basis of consciousness.

His outraged friends -- &#x2014;mostly poor cotton farmers -- form a secret society, Hell-at-the-Breech, to punish the townspeople they believe responsible. The hooded members wage a bloody year-long campaign of terror that culminates in a massacre where the innocent suffer alongside the guilty. Caught in the maelstrom of the Mitcham war are four people: the aging sheriff sympathetic to both sides; the widowed midwife who delivered nearly every member of Hell-at-the-Breech; a ruthless detective who wages his own war against the gang; and a young store clerk who harbors a terrible secret.</p><p>Based on incidents that occurred a few miles from the author's childhood home, <em>Hell at the Breech</em> chronicles the events of dark days that led the people involved to discover their capacity for good, evil, or for both.</p></p><p><p>Tom Franklin is the <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author of <em>Crooked Letter, Crooked Letter</em>, which won the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> Book Prize and the Crime Writers' Association's Gold Dagger Award. His previous works include <em>Poachers</em>, <em>Hell at the Breech</em>, and <em>Smonk</em>. He teaches in the University of Mississippi's MFA program.</p>This immensely accomplished novel by the author of the Edgar Award-winning short story collection Poachers is based on a real-life feud in the 1890s that pitted the underclass-poor, mostly white sharecroppers-of Clarke County, Ala., against the land-owning gentry who could and did control their fate. But that simple summary does not do justice to the complex and incredibly violent events that shook the community. The seeds of the violent uprising are planted when Macky Burke, a poor, white teenage orphan living with his grandmother, the widow Gates, accidentally shoots local merchant Arch Bedsole during a holdup. Arch's enraged cousin, Quincy "Tooch" Bedsole, a down-at-the-heels farmer, cultivates those seeds with a mixture of resentment, greed and a desire for vengeance. He forms the "Hell-at-the-Breech" gang, made up of criminals and struggling white tenant farmers who but for their guns are nearly as powerless as the former slaves they compete with for work. Hell-at-the-Breech terrorizes Clarke County, exacting frontier justice (and cash) from the exploitative landowners, driving black sharecroppers out of the county and menacing the white farmers who are too law-abiding to join their ranks. Fighting the outbreak of violence is Sheriff Billy Waite, an essentially good man trying to keep the peace and administer justice in a lawless world. Despite an unremitting catalogue of violence, this gory book is a pleasure to read for its clean, unexpected turns of phrase (in a cotton field, "each tuft [is] white as a senator's eyebrow"); the laconic humor of its characters ("Rumors fly out of Mitcham Beat like hair in a catfight"); and vibrant, complex characters who spring from the pages. Franklin may have used history as a starting point, but he imagines the events in human terms, creating a book that transmutes historical fact into something much more powerful, dramatic and compelling.<br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>A View from the Buggy: True and Inspiring Stories of the Amish Life</h2><p><p>Most of us want a simpler life, and there&#x2019;s no better example of the simple life than found among the Amish.

Replete with the brutality, primordial waste, and savage blankness familiar to readers of his earlier works, Evenson's Kafkaesque allegories entice the mind while stubbornly disordering it. In the title story an obsessive consciousness folds back on itself, creating a vertiginous m�lange of Poe and Borges, both horrific and metaphysical. Here, as in "Moran's Mexico," and "Greenhouse," the solitary nature of reading and writing leads characters beyond human limits, making the act of putting words to paper a monstrous violation opening onto madness. In "White Square" the representation of humans by dimly colored shapes confirms our feeling that something lies behind these words, while seeming to mock us with the futility of seeking it. Evenson's enigmatic names-Thurm, Bein, Hatcher, Burlun-placeable landscapes, and barren rooms all combine to create a semblance of conceptual abstraction, as though the material universe had come to exist inside someone's head. <br><br>Small wonder that Evenson's work has attracted so much attention among philosophers, literary critics, and other speculative intelligences, for it continuously projects a tantalizing absence, as though there were some key or code that, if only we knew it, would illuminate everything.

These efforts became known as<i> filibustering</i>, and their goal was to seize territory to create new independent fiefdoms, which would ultimately be annexed by the still-growing United States. Most failed miserably.<br><br> William Walker was the outlier.

But the fantasies in this book aren&#x2019;t fiction. They are the real erotic imaginings of real women . . . and nothing is more exciting than that. <br><br>Nancy Friday, whose collections of women&#x2019;s sexual fantasies include <i>My Secret Garden </i>and <i>Forbidden Flowers, </i>offers up &#x201c;a smorgasbord of sensual scenarios&#x201d; (<i>New Women</i>) in this explicit <i>New York Times </i>bestseller that puts women in control of their sexual destinies. Nearly two hundred women contributed, in their own uncensored words and through interviews with the author, the shocking, daring, amusing, untamed, and pulse-pounding imaginings that turn them on the most. &#x201c;The fantasies are fascinating,&#x201d; raves <i>Esquire </i>magazine, no doubt because unlike anything any novel could ever truly capture, they allow open access to what women <i>really </i>desire.</p><p><b>Nancy Friday</b> is the bestselling author of <i>My Secret Garden, Jealousy, Men in Love, My Mother/My Self, Women on Top, The Power of Beauty</i> and, most recently, <i>Our Looks, Our Lives.</i> She lives in Key West, Florida, and in Connecticut.<b>Part 1: Report from the Erotic Interior</b>It's an odd time to be writing about sex. Not at all like the late 1960s and 1970s, when the air was charged with sexual curiosity, women's lives were changing at a rate of geometric progression, and the exploration of women's sexuality -- well, it ranked right up there with the struggle for economic equality.<br>Today's sexual climate is somber. Gone are the lively debates and writings about sex as part of our humanity. The toll of AIDS, reports from the abortion battlefield, and the alarming rise of unintended pregnancies make sex seem more risky than joyful.<br>By their sheer numbers young men and women twenty years ago made sex a burning issue; later when the time came to go on to more "serious" business, they put the sexual revolution to bed. Implicit in the prim set of their lips today is that they overdid it twenty years ago; like good Calvinist children the Establishment now punishes itself for its former naughty excesses and righteously turns its back on sex. Because they are still the majority who make the rules and write the headlines, they assume they speak for everyone.<br>They know little of the women in this book.<br>These women are for the most part in their twenties, the generation that followed the sexual revolution and the initial momentum of the women's movement. Their voices sound like a new race of women compared to those in <i>My Secret Garden,</i> my first book on women's sexual fantasies, which was published in 1973 and is now in its twenty-ninth printing. While they have all read that earlier book and taken heart from it, these young women accept their sexual fantasies as a natural extension of their lives. Given the unique period in women's history in which they grew up, how could it be otherwise?<br>For them the explosive emotions we unleashed in the 1970s are still very much alive. There has never been a sexual hiatus, a cooling-off period. Sex is a given, an energy not to be deferred for "more important things." Their sexual fantasies are startling reflections of their determination to abandon nothing.<br>Here is a collective imagination that could not have existed twenty years ago, when women had no vocabulary, no permission, and no shared identity in which to describe their sexual feelings. Those first voices were tentative and filled with guilt, not for having done anything but simply for daring to admit the inadmissible: that they had erotic thoughts that sexually aroused them.<br>More than any other emotion, guilt determined the story lines of the fantasies in <i>My Secret Garden.</i> Here were hundreds of women inventing ploys to get past their fear that wanting to reach orgasm made them Bad Girls. All in the privacy of their own minds, where no one would know. But in the mind of the symbiotic child, mother did know. The daughter could be grown and with children of her own, but if she had never emotionally separated from that first person who controlled her totally, how was she to know what was mother's opinion, what was her own? It was as if mother continued to sit in judgment throughout the daughter's life, wagging her finger at the daughter's every sexual move and thought.<br>The most popular guilt-avoiding device was the so-called rape fantasy -- "so-called" because no rape, bodily harm, or humiliation took place in the fantasy. It simply had to be understood that what went on was against the woman's will. Saying she was "raped" was the most expedient way of getting past the big No to sex that had been imprinted on her mind since early childhood. (Let me add that the women were emphatic that these were not suppressed wishes; I never encountered a woman who said she really wanted to be raped.)<br>Anonymity also helped. The men in these fantasies were faceless strangers invented to further insure the women against involvement, responsibility, the possibility of a relationship. These males did their job and left. Being fucked by the faceless stranger made it doubly clear: "This pleasure is not my fault! I'm still a Nice Girl, Mom."<br>Certainly sexual guilt hasn't disappeared, nor has the rape fantasy. There is something very workmanlike and reliable about the traditional bullies and bad people whose intractable presence allows the woman to reach her goal, orgasm. But most of the women in this book take guilt as a given, like the danger of speeding cars. Guilt, they've learned, comes from without, from mother, from church. Sex comes from within and is their entitlement. Guilt, therefore, must be controlled, mastered, and used to heighten excitement. If there is a rape fantasy, today's woman is just as likely to flip the scenario into one in which she overpowers and rapes the man. This sort of thing just didn't happen in <i>My Secret Garden.</i><br>Fantasy is where the sexual drive does battle with opposing emotions, the selection of which comes out of our individual lives, our earliest sexual histories. What were the forbidden feelings we took in as we grew? In these new fantasies, the emotions that most often dictate the story lines are anger, the desire for control, and the determination to experience the fullest sexual release.<br>Admitting to anger is new for women. In the days of <i>My Secret Garden,</i> nice women didn't express anger. They choked on it and turned whatever rage they felt against themselves.<br>Anger is still a difficult emotion for women to voice in reality, primarily because we get no practice expressing it in that first, most important relationship, opposite mother. But women today at least know they are entitled to anger, and fantasy is a safe playground where they can show rage at all the obstacles that stand in their way, beginning with rage at the enormous difficulty in being sexual plus all the other things a woman today must be. These new women have no models, no blueprints. They have to make themselves up. One of the ways they try out new roles is in their erotic dreams.<br>Don't misunderstand me; this is not just a book about angry women. These are women's voices finally dealing with the full lexicon of human emotion, sexual imagery and language. Anger is inextricably involved with lust in reality as well as in the erotic imagination. Men's sexual fantasies are also filled with rage at war with eroticism. They take a different story line from women's largely because of men's earliest experiences with woman/mother. But rage is a human emotion, and though history until recently tells us otherwise, it is not exclusive to one sex.<br>I will never forget these women, for they have swept me up in their enthusiasm and taught me too. "Take that!" they say, using their erotic muscle to seduce or subdue anyone or anything that stands in the way of orgasm. They take the knowledge won by an earlier generation of women who couldn't use it themselves, still being too close to the taboos against which they rebelled. These women look mother square in the face and have their orgasm too.<br>I have always believed that our erotic daydreams are the true X rays of our sexual souls, and like our dreams at night they change as new people and situations enter our lives to be played out against the primitive backdrop of our childhood. An analyst collects his patients' dreams like gold coins. We should value our erotic reveries no less seriously, because they are the complex expressions of what we consciously desire and unconsciously fear. To know them is to know ourselves better.<br>Like the X ray of a broken bone held up to the light, a fantasy reveals the healthy line of human sexual desire and shows where this conscious wish to feel sexual has been shattered by a fear so old and threatening as to be unconscious pressure. As children we feared that the sexual feeling would lose us the love of someone upon whom we depended for life itself; the guilt, planted early and deep, arose because we didn't want the forbidden sexual feeling to go away. Now it is fantasy's job to get us past the fear/guilt/anxiety. The characters and story lines we conjure up take what was most forbidden, and with the omnipotent power of the mind, make the forbidden work for us so that now, just for a moment, we may rise to orgasm and release.<br>Here, for the first time, these women's voices make it undeniably clear that our erotic fantasies have changed in juxtaposition to what has happened in the past years; they are not simply masturbatory diversions, derivatives of <i>Playboy</i> cartoons, but brilliant insights into what motivates real life -- clues to our identity as valuable as the dreams we dream at night.<br>This is not a scientific report. I am by choice not a Ph.D., having decided long ago to retain the writer's freedom. Also, it has always been my belief that women tell me things they say they've never told a living soul because I am Nancy to them and not Dr. Friday. This book, along with <i>My Secret Garden</i> and <i>Forbidden Flowers,</i> its sequel, represent a unique chronicle of women's sexual fantasies. Before <i>My Secret Garden</i> was published, there was nothing on the subject. The assumption was that women did not have sexual fantasies.<br>The sexual fantasies in <i>Women on Top</i> cover the years from 1980 to the present. They were selected from interviews and letters written to me in answer to an invitation to women who wished to contribute to a future book on women's sexual fantasies. The request was printed in the back of <i>My Secret Garden</i> and <i>Forbidden Flowers.</i> I gave a P.O. Box number and promised anonymity.<br>My contributors and I may form a special population: I am sufficiently fascinated by sexuality to write about it, and they to read my books and then write to me for reasons ranging from the desire for validation of their sexuality -- "I am signing my real name because I want you to know I exist!" -- to the exhibitionistic pleasure of seeing their words in print. But there can be no doubt that those who have written speak for a far larger population.<br>I have chosen to arrange the fantasies in three chapters which denote the themes that most frequently turned up in the thousands of letters and interviews I collected since my earlier books: women in control, women with women, and sexually insatiable women. I've arranged them in chronological order so that we could see how changes in the real world influence the erotic imagination.<br>Let me tell you how I came to this subject. In the late 1960s I chose to write about women's sexual fantasies because the subject was unbroken ground, a missing piece in the puzzle, and I loved original research. I had sexual fantasies and I assumed other women did too. But when I spoke to friends and people in the publishing world, they said they'd never heard of a woman's sexual fantasy. Nor was there a single reference to women's sexual fantasies in the card catalogues at the New York Public Library, the Yale University library, or the British Museum library, which carry millions upon millions of books -- not a word on the sexual imagery in the minds of half the world.<br>Publishers were intrigued, however, for it was a time in history when the world was suddenly curious about sex and women's sexuality in particular. Editors were frantically signing up any writer who could help flesh out this undiscovered continent called Woman.<br>I remember vividly the first publisher who rejected <i>My Secret Garden.</i> When I mentioned the outline I had drawn up along with a sampling of fantasies, he salivated. "Women's sexual fantasies!" he juicily exclaimed, and then pleaded for me to send them to his office soon, soonest! Before the day was over, they'd been returned, doublesealed, to my apartment. What had he expected? I'll never know, but the ritual was to be repeated by almost every publisher in New York. Let me quickly add that women editors as well as men hated the evidence of what women's sexual fantasies actually were.<br>This was not innocence on their part, merely their wish not to be told something they had silently always known: We women fantasize just like men, and the images are not always pretty. We know everything long before we are ready to know it, and so we cling to our denials.<br>As for the behavioral world, the dozens of psychologists and psychiatrists I interviewed informed me that I was on a deadend street. "Only men have sexual fantasies," they told me. As late as June 1973, the same month <i>My Secret Garden</i> was published, permissive <i>Cosmopolitan</i> magazine printed a cover story by the eminent and equally permissive Dr. Allan Fromme, stating, "Women do not have sexual fantasies....The reason for this is obvious: Women haven't been brought up to enjoy sex...women are by and large destitute of sexual fantasy."<br>Initially the women I interviewed bore out Fromme's prophecy. "What's a sexual fantasy?" they would ask, or, "What do you mean by suggesting I have sexual fantasies? I love my husband!" or, "Who needs fantasy? My real sex life is great." Even the most sexually active women I knew, who wanted to be part of the research, would strain to understand and then shake their heads.<br>Then I learned the power of permission that comes from other women's voices. Only when I told them my own fantasies did recognition dawn. No man, certainly not Dr. Fromme, could have persuaded these women to drop the veil from the preconscious -- that level of consciousness between the unconscious and full awareness -- and reveal the fantasy they had repeatedly enjoyed and then denied. Only women can liberate other women; only women's voices grant permission to be sexual, to be free to be anything we want, when enough of us tell one another it is okay.<br>Finally after three years of slow-going research -- one-on-one interviews, magazine articles inviting women to contribute, advertisements in everything from the <i>Village Voice</i> to the <i>London Times</i> (<i>New York</i> magazine was too virginal to run the ad) -- <i>My Secret Garden</i> was published in 1973. After publication there was a final salvo from the media accusing me of inventing the entire book, having made up all the fantasies. (The Cleveland <i>Plain Dealer</i> reviewed the book on its sports page, a last defensive hee-haw.)<br>But within months it seemed that women's erotic reveries had been with us always, so much so that advertisers were using fantasy as a selling tool before the year was over. Today women's magazines, films, books, television, automatically employ fantasy to explain and make real a woman's character. It is astonishing, when you think about it, how quickly women's fantasies have been incorporated into our universal understanding of woman.<br>Timing is everything. When there is an absolute need to know something, when an intellectual void must be filled, we will accept what only moments earlier we'd rejected for centuries. In 1973 a number of social and economic currents came together, forcing women to understand themselves and change their lives. Sexual identity was a vital missing link. The time was right to take the lid of repression off women's sexual fantasies.<br>Four years later it would be the identical story with <i>My Mother/My Self,</i> the book that grew immediately out of <i>My Secret Garden's</i> questioning of the source of women's terrible guilt about sex. Initially this later book was violently rejected by both publishers and readers. "I threw your book across the room!" "I wanted to kill you!" were typical reader's comments. But what followed was a snowballing acceptance as one woman told another to read this book that talked about the unmentionable: the mother/daughter relationship (another subject about which there was not a word in any of the libraries). If we were to change the repetitious pattern of women's lives, we had to honestly accept what we had with her/mother.

Here again, years later, are all the sturdy pioneers of the earlier novel, R�lvaag's "vikings of the prairie"&#x2014;Per Hansa's Beret and their children, Syvert T�nseten and Kjersti, and S�rine. The great struggle against the land itself has been won. Now there is to be a second struggle, a struggle to adapt, to become Americans.The development of the Spring Creek settlement in these years is manifested in the rebellious growing up of Peder Victorious. Peder is a beautiful and moving novel of youth and youth's self-discovery. It is the story, too, of Beret's pain and dismay at the Americanization of her children, what R�lvaag described as the true tragedy of the immigrants, who made their children part of a world to which they themselves could never belong.Out of the inevitable conflict between the first-generation American and his still Norwegian mother, R�lvaag built a powerful novel of personal growth, guilt, and victory.</p><p>The development of the Spring Creek settlement in these years is manifested in the rebellious growing up of Peder Victorious.

And sue her for being human, but when a man had a pair of shoulders that wide and a butt that was almost ridiculously proportionately not-�that-�wide . . . one&#x2019;s eyes tended to be drawn instinctively down toward that seemingly miraculous not-�wideness.<br><br>Truly though, it was the combo of what was covering that noteworthy derri�re&#x2014;�a pair of very nicely fitting camo cargo shorts&#x2014;�plus his trademark flip-�flops with a snug olive drab T-�shirt that had brought about her initial surge of recognition. She confirmed it&#x2014;�yup, that was definitely her local Navy SEAL&#x2014;�when he turned a head that was covered with regulation-�defyingly shaggy, sun-�streaked golden-�brown hair to reveal his too-�handsome face.<br><br>Those eyes had to be blue.<br><br>Even though he&#x2019;d moved into Shayla&#x2019;s neighborhood nearly two months ago, she still hadn&#x2019;t gotten close enough to the man to be absolutely certain, but really, she knew. Neon blue. Had to be. And they probably twinkled and sparkled, too.<br><br>Still, even from a sparkle-�obscuring distance, the man was hard to miss. And Shay&#x2019;s curiosity had pinged when he&#x2019;d pulled a U-�Haul in front of the sweet little bungalow-�for-�rent across the street and her elderly and possibly omnipotent neighbor Mrs. Quinn had muttered, &#x201c;Just what we need, as if it weren&#x2019;t already too noisy here,&#x201d; before darkly IDing him as a Navy SEAL.<br><br>Navy SEAL, hmm? So yes, Shayla had looked at him and his perfect butt a tad more thoroughly than she otherwise might&#x2019;ve.<br><br>Tonight however, the man was hard to miss for another reason. He&#x2019;d practically leapt full out into the middle of the oncoming traffic&#x2014;�and there was a lot more of it than usual for a Wednesday evening near the high school.<br><br>Shayla hit her brakes and leaned forward slightly to peer at him through her windshield, wondering if he&#x2019;d been attempting to stop that one specific car in front of her, or if any old car and driver would do.<br><br>Bow chicka bow bow! Harry Parker&#x2019;s irreverent voice-�in-�her-�head now sang a riff that was supposed to imitate the porn-�worthy wah-�wah of an electric guitar.<br><br>Shut it, she told him silently since he was a fictional character and therefore invisible, and she wasn&#x2019;t quite crazy enough to start talking to herself out loud. At least not yet.<br><br>And apparently, the SEAL wasn&#x2019;t picky, because he didn&#x2019;t wait for her to stop completely before he tried to open her passenger side door.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, can you help me, I&#x2019;m not dangerous, I promise,&#x201d; he called to her through the closed window, but she was already hitting the button that popped the lock.<br><br>It was pretty clear he didn&#x2019;t recognize her&#x2014;�probably because she&#x2019;d never gotten around to bringing over a pie to welcome him, his sullen teenaged daughter, and their obvious lack of a Mrs. Navy SEAL to the neighborhood.<br><br>That was what Harry, in his infinite-�yet-�fictional wisdom, had recommended Shayla do. Wear a top with a neckline that plunged and bring her hot new Navy SEAL neighbor a homemade pie. It was a brilliant plan, except nearly all of her tops were crew-�necked Ts. And then there was that tiny, pesky fact that she&#x2019;d never baked a pie before in her life.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m a SEAL, an officer.&#x201d; It was the first thing the man said as he opened her car door and climbed in. He obviously understood the clout of that, particularly here in US-�NavyLand, or as civilians called it, San Diego. &#x201c;Lieutenant Peter Greene. Thank you for stopping.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re welcome,&#x201d; Shayla said, oddly tongue-�tied at their sudden proximity. Her small car seemed smaller than usual because those shoulders were broad. And his movie-�star handsomeness stood up to this closer view. In fact, his evenly featured face could&#x2019;ve gone into the dictionary next to perfectly symmetrical. Or maybe just plain perfect. Also, he smelled good. Like sunblock and fresh air and a scent she assumed was pure Navy SEAL hotness.<br><br>Even Harry was uncharacteristically silent.<br><br>And alas, even though she&#x2019;d spent her career writing books where this kind of impromptu meet-�cute would end with them having screaming animal-�sex before the clock struck midnight, Shayla wasn&#x2019;t as bold as her romance novel heroines. She didn&#x2019;t look all that much like them, either. In fact, she was lucky that she&#x2019;d showered and put on real pants before she&#x2019;d crawled away from her computer in order to drive-�and-�drop Frankie at his high school debate club practice. Most of the time she just climbed into her car from the safety of the shuttlebay&#x2014;�aka their closed garage&#x2014;�wearing her plaid PJs beneath her jacket.<br><br>She cleared her throat and managed, &#x201c;What&#x2019;s, um, going on? Are you okay?&#x201d;<br><br>But he was already talking. Explaining. &#x201c;My daughter is missing, and I think I just saw her getting into a car heading north.&#x201d; He gestured to the busy road in front of them.<br><br>Missing.<br><br>With two kids of her own, that was a word to chill her to the very depths of her soul. Shayla could still work herself into a cold sweat by remembering that horrible day Tevin had gone on a class day-�trip into Boston, but hadn&#x2019;t been on the bus when it returned to the middle school parking lot. That was when they were still living back in Massachusetts, and it turned out that he&#x2019;d run into his father near the State House. Tevin had stayed in the city to have dinner&#x2014;�and both he and Carter, now her ex, had wrongly assumed the other would call to tell her. Neither had.<br><br>Before Shayla had located the teacher who knew what was going on, it had been a very frightening few minutes&#x2014;�the likes of which she hoped she&#x2019;d never again experience.<br><br>Now she immediately jammed her car into gear and surged back into the traffic amidst the blaring horns of the drivers she&#x2019;d cut off.<br><br>&#x201c;Whoa,&#x201d; the SEAL said, quickly fastening his seat belt. &#x201c;Wow. Thank you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;This is what you wanted, right? Follow that car?&#x201d; she asked as she jockeyed her way into the faster-�moving left lane. Funny how that horrible word, missing, had magically turned him from too-�hot-�to-�talk-�to Navy SEAL to far more accessible worried dad. Hot worried dad, sure, but he needed both her help and immediate action, and accordingly her brain had unlocked. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry, I&#x2019;m a good driver.&#x201d;<br><br>She really is. Great. Harry, too, had gotten his voice back.<br><br>Of course, the SEAL couldn&#x2019;t hear him, thank God. &#x201c;Glad to hear it,&#x201d; he said as he grabbed for the oh-�shit bar, which, yes, made his muscular arm do some very interesting and attractive things to his barbed wire tattoo. Maybe it would help if she imagined those strong arms holding a baby, except . . .<br><br>Noooo, that doesn&#x2019;t help at all, Harry said.<br><br>Harry was married. Very married, to the man of his dreams, she thought pointedly.<br><br>He laughed. True, but I&#x2019;m also very not dead, so . . .<br><br>Shayla hip-�checked him out of her head and focused on the task at hand. &#x201c;Which car are we following?&#x201d; she asked the SEAL crisply, eyes on the road ahead of her. &#x201c;Make, model, color . . . ?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Maroon sedan. Buick, maybe?&#x201d; said the real, nonfictional man sitting beside her. His voice had the vowel sounds and musical phrasing of a California surfer. In fact, he sounded a little bit like Luke or Owen Wilson, as if maybe they&#x2019;d all attended the same SoCal high school. &#x201c;Older model. Extra large. POS with a peeling soft-�top. Don&#x2019;t stop don&#x2019;t stop don&#x2019;t stop!&#x201d;<br><br>As she watched, the very stale yellow traffic light in front of her turned red, but she jammed down the gas pedal and blasted through it. Missing. If they got pulled over, hopefully the cop would be the parent of a teenager, too.<br><br>&#x201c;How long has your daughter been, you know?&#x201d; She couldn&#x2019;t say that awful word, as if it were a snake that might bite her if she acknowledged it.<br><br>&#x201c;Missing?&#x201d; The SEAL said it in unison with Harry.<br><br>&#x201c;Last time I saw Maddie was yesterday morning,&#x201d; the SEAL added, &#x201c;when I dropped her at school. She didn&#x2019;t come home last night, and when I called the school to check today, apparently she didn&#x2019;t make it to homeroom yesterday either, so . . . Yeah. It&#x2019;s been about thirty-�six hours. Jesus.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;They didn&#x2019;t call you yesterday when she didn&#x2019;t show?&#x201d; Shayla was surprised. She glanced over to find him looking back at her just as the headlights from a passing car lit his face. Eyes, neon blue. Check. But not so much with the twinkle, considering his current case of teenage-�daughter-�induced grim.<br><br>&#x201c;They said they did, but no,&#x201d; the SEAL reported as they both continued to search the traffic for the car in question. &#x201c;There wasn&#x2019;t a message on the home line or my cell.&#x201d;<br><br>Yikes. That was pretty extreme incompetence for the high school administration&#x2014;�a dedicated team that Shayla knew and trusted.<br><br>Or, Harry said, Maddie hacked the system and changed her parental contact number.<br><br>&#x201c;She good with computers?&#x201d; Shayla asked the SEAL.<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think so,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>If she had hacking skills, he&#x2019;d definitely know, Harry stated. But really all she&#x2019;d need is a hacker for a friend. Or boyfriend.<br><br>&#x201c;How old is she?&#x201d; Shayla asked. The petite, ghostlike, dark-�haired, baggy-�clothes-�wearing girl she&#x2019;d seen drifting mournfully from the house to her father&#x2019;s truck early each school day could&#x2019;ve been anywhere from twelve to eighteen.<br><br>&#x201c;Fifteen,&#x201d; he reported.<br><br>&#x201c;Mine are seventeen and fourteen,&#x201d; she told him. &#x201c;Both boys.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Boys,&#x201d; the SEAL said almost wistfully. &#x201c;I could probably handle a boy. I understand boys.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Girls really aren&#x2019;t that much different,&#x201d; Shayla pointed out as Harry said, Nope, nope, nope, too early in this relationship for a feminist diatribe!<br><br>What relationship? She was helping out a neighbor. And how was that a diatribe? Still, all Shayla wanted was to help this man find his missing child, so as she continued to push ahead in the still-�thick traffic, she asked the SEAL, &#x201c;Have you tried tracking her phone? Does she have a smartphone?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes to both but she turned off her GPS.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Or her battery&#x2019;s run out,&#x201d; she suggested.<br><br>&#x201c;Nah, she took her charger.&#x201d; The SEAL seemed certain of that. But then he acquiesced. &#x201c;At least it wasn&#x2019;t where she normally keeps it in her room. As far as her phone goes, I texted and called her nonstop last night when she didn&#x2019;t come home&#x2014;�right up until she blocked me. I thought about shutting her down, you know, canceling her number, killing her service completely, but . . . I&#x2019;m afraid without her phone she&#x2019;ll be even less safe, so . . .&#x201d;<br><br>Ooh, he&#x2019;s a deep thinker. No angry knee-�jerking. I like that in a man who can probably kill you with just his pinkie finger, Harry said.<br><br>&#x201c;Also,&#x201d; the SEAL continued as he glanced at Shayla again with those ocean-�colored eyes, &#x201c;this way I can still use someone else&#x2019;s phone to text her. Although she&#x2019;s already blocked Zanella&#x2014;�a teammate of mine, and Eden, his wife. But I figure Maddie can&#x2019;t block everyone I know, right? There!&#x201d;<br><br>He&#x2019;d spotted the maroon car. &#x201c;Where?&#x201d; Shayla searched the traffic but she couldn&#x2019;t see it.<br><br>&#x201c;Five cars ahead, right lane,&#x201d; the SEAL told her. &#x201c;Damn it, they&#x2019;re turning!&#x201d;<br><br>And she was still in the left lane. &#x201c;Hold on!&#x201d; Luckily there was no one directly behind her so she hit the brakes hard and waited for the line of traffic in the right lane to open up before stomping on the gas and taking that same right turn with squealing tires.<br><br>&#x201c;Nice,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Thanks. You are good.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;If your daughter&#x2019;s in that car, then we are going to find her.&#x201d; It was the kind of dramatic but heartfelt line that Shayla usually let Harry say in one of her books. It felt a little weird coming out of her mouth since, unlike Harry, she was neither courageous nor daring nor a highly skilled FBI agent. But she meant it. Sincerely.<br><br>She could now see the car in question. It was indeed a piece of shit, or POS, as the lieutenant had said&#x2014;�a barge-�like relic from the 1970s. There were two cars and a van between them, but this was a smaller road with a single lane in each direction. And there was a lot of oncoming traffic. Although maybe if she timed it right . . .<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t even think about it,&#x201d; the SEAL murmured. &#x201c;No one&#x2019;s that good of a driver. Also, I don&#x2019;t want to get too close in case she sees me and tries to bolt. All I need is some inexperienced kid wrapping that car&#x2014;�and Maddie&#x2014;�around a tree.&#x201d;<br><br>Smart, Harry murmured as Shay nodded. Have I mentioned I like him?</p><h2>Leaving Tangier: A Novel</h2><p><b>From one of the world's great writers, a novel that mirrors the journeys of millions who leave home for a better life</b><br><br> In <i>Leaving Tangier</i>, award-winning, internationally bestselling author Tahar Ben Jelloun tells the story of a Moroccan brother and sister making new lives for themselves in Spain. Azel is a young man in Tangier who dreams of crossing the Strait of Gibraltar. When he meets Miguel, a wealthy Spaniard, he leaves behind his girlfriend, his sister, Kenza, and his mother, and moves with him to Barcelona, where Kenza eventually joins them. What they find there forms the heart of this novel of seduction and betrayal, deception and disillusionment, in which Azel and Kenza are reminded powerfully not only of where they've come from, but also of who they really are.</p><p><b>Tahar Ben Jelloun</b> was born in 1944 in Fez, Morocco, and emigrated to France in 1961. A novelist, essayist, critic, and poet, he is a regular contributor to <i>Le Monde</i>, <i>La Republica</i>, <i>El Pa�s, </i>and <i>Panorama</i>. His novels include <i>The Sacred Night</i> (winner of the 1987 Prix Goncourt), <i>Corruption</i>, and <i>The Last Friend</i>. Ben Jelloun won the 1994 Prix Maghreb, and in 2004 he won the International IMPAC Dublin Literary Award for <i>This Blinding Absence of Light</i>.<b>1</b><p><b>Toutia</b></p><p>In Tangier, in the winter, the Caf� Hafa becomes an observatory for dreams and their aftermath. Cats from the cemetery, the terraces, and the chief communal bread oven of the Marshan district gather round the caf� as if to watch the play unfolding there in silence, and fooling nobody. Long pipes of kif pass from table to table while glasses of mint tea grow cold, enticing bees that eventually tumble in, a matter of indifference to customers long since lost to the limbo of hashish and tinseled reverie. In the back of one room, two men meticulously prepare the key that opens the gates of departure, selecting leaves, then chopping them swiftly and efficiently. Neither man looks up. Leaning back against the wall, customers sit on mats and stare at the horizon as if seeking to read their fate. They look at the sea, at the clouds that blend into the mountains, and they wait for the twinkling lights of Spain to appear. They watch them without seeing them, and sometimes, even when the lights are lost in fog and bad weather, they see them anyway.</p><p>Everyone is silent. Everyone listens. Perhaps <i>she</i> will show up this evening. She&#x2019;ll talk to them, sing them the song of the drowned man who became a sea star suspended over the straits. They have agreed never to speak her name: that would destroy her, and provoke a whole series of misfortunes as well. So the men watch one another and say nothing. Each one enters his dream and clenches his fists. Only the waiters and the tea master, who owns the caf�, remain outside the circle, preparing and serving their fare with discretion, coming and going from terrace to terrace without disturbing anyone&#x2019;s dream. The customers know one another but do not converse. Most of them come from the same neighborhood and have just enough to pay for the tea and a few pipes of kif. Some have a slate on which they keep track of their debt. As if by agreement, they keep silent. Especially at this hour and at this delicate moment when their whole being is caught up in the distance, studying the slightest ripple of the waves or the sound of an old boat coming home to the harbor. Sometimes, hearing the echo of a cry for help, they look at one another without turning a hair.</p><p>Yes, she might appear, and reveal a few of her secrets. Conditions are favorable: a clear, almost white sky, reflected in a limpid sea transformed into a pool of light. Silence in the caf�; silence on all faces. Perhaps the precious moment has arrived . . . at last she will speak!</p><p>Occasionally the men do allude to her, especially when the sea has tossed up the bodies of a few drowned souls. She has acquired more riches, they say, and surely owes us a favor! They have nicknamed her Toutia, a word that means nothing, but to them she is a spider that can feast on human flesh yet will sometimes tell them, in the guise of a beneficent voice, that tonight is not the night, that they must put off their voyage for a while.</p><p>Like children, they believe in this story that comforts them and lulls them to sleep as they lean back against the rough wall. In the tall glasses of cold tea, the green mint has been tarnished black. The bees have all drowned at the bottom. The men no longer sip this tea now steeped into bitterness. With a spoon they fish the bees out one by one, laying them on the table and exclaiming, &#x201c;Poor little drowned things, victims of their own greediness!&#x201d;</p><p>As in an absurd and persistent dream, Azel sees his naked body among other naked bodies swollen by seawater, his face distorted by salt and longing, his skin burnt by the sun, split open across the chest as if there had been fighting before the boat went down. Azel sees his body more and more clearly, in a blue and white fishing boat heading ever so slowly to the center of the sea, for Azel has decided that this sea has a center and that this center is a green circle, a cemetery where the current catches hold of corpses, taking them to the bottom to place them on a bank of seaweed. He knows that there, in this specific circle, a fluid boundary exists, a kind of separation between the sea and the ocean, the calm, smooth waters of the Mediterranean and the fierce surge of the Atlantic. He holds his nose, because staring so hard at these images has filled his nostrils with the odor of death, a suffocating, clinging, nauseating stench. When he closes his eyes, death begins to dance around the table where he sits almost every day to watch the sunset and count the first lights scintillating across the way, on the coast of Spain. His friends join him, to play cards in silence. Even if some of them share his obsession of leaving the country someday, they know, having heard it one night in Toutia&#x2019;s voice, that they must not lose themselves in images that foster sadness.</p><p>Azel says not a word about either his plan or his dream. People sense that he is unhappy, on edge, and they say he is bewitched by love for a married woman. They believe he has flings with foreign women and suspect that he wants their help to leave Morocco. He denies this, of course, preferring to laugh about it. But the idea of sailing away, of mounting a green-painted horse and crossing the sea of the straits, that idea of becoming a transparent shadow visible only by day, an image scudding at top speed across the waves&#x2014;that idea never leaves him now. He keeps it to himself, doesn&#x2019;t mention it to his sister, Kenza, still less to his mother, who worries because he is losing weight and smoking too much.</p><p>Even Azel has come to believe in the story of she who will appear and help them to cross, one by one, that distance separating them from life, the good life, or death.</p></p><h2>Guava Moon Revenge, An Alex Rutledge Novel</h2><p>Alex is back... He did not want to be. A long-awaited vacation in Grand Cayman ends too soon for Rutledge and Detective Beth Watkins when Beth learns that someone has killed her houseguest, Elaine Ogilvy. Alex and Beth return quickly to Key West and, from the moment of their arrival, events suggest they might be in danger as well. A photographer who prefers ad agency and magazine jobs, Alex has no training in police work. Still, he often gets drawn into Florida Keys investigations. Monroe County Sheriff, Fred (Chicken Neck) Liska, trusts Alex (usually), and The Aristocrats (off-kilter private eyes Dubbie Tanner and Wiley Fecko) provide off-the-books surveillance, background checks and info gathering. Everyone knows that success is not guaranteed. The father of the victim, Parke Ogilvy, whom Watkins knew long ago, comes to the island and offers the names of the ex-lovers of his daughter, one of whom could be in the Florida Keys. DNA crime evidence, a second murder, threats against friends and, for Alex, a solid link to events in his past boost the peril. Even with law enforcement at full force, Rutledge senses that only his actions will lead to a crime solution.</p><p>Tom Corcoran is the author of The Alex Rutledge Series: The Mango Opera, Gumbo Limbo, Bone Island Mambo, Octopus Alibi, Air Dance Iguana, Hawk Channel Chase, and The Quick Adios (Times Six) plus the spinoff novel Crime Almost Pays.

She lives with her family outside Washington, D.C.<i>Chapter One</i><br>LEAVING THE CHURCH, she felt the wind rise, felt the pinprick of pebble and grit against her stockings and her cheeks&#x2014;the slivered shards of mad sunlight in her eyes. She paused, still on the granite steps, touched the brim of her hat and the flying hem of her skirt&#x2014;felt the wind rush up her cuffs and rattle her sleeves.<br><br>And all before her, the lunch-hour crowd bent under the April sun and into the bitter April wind, jackets flapping and eyes squinting, or else skirts pressed to the backs of legs and jacket hems pressed to bottoms. And trailing them, outrunning them, skittering along the gutter and the sidewalk and the low gray steps of the church, banging into ankles and knees and one another, scraps of paper, newspapers, candy wrappers, what else?&#x2014;office memos? shopping lists? The paper detritus that she had somewhere read, or had heard it said, trails armies, or was it (she had seen a photograph) the scraps of letters and wrappers and snapshots that blow across battlefields after all but the dead have fled?<br><br>She squinted against the sunlight on taxi hoods and bus windows, heard the rushing now of air and of taxis, wheezing buses, and underneath it all something banging&#x2014;a loosened street sign, a trapped can, a distant hammer&#x2014;rhythmic and methodical. The march of time.<br><br>And then George approaching, his hand stuck to his hat and the hat bent into the onslaught. She went down the steps just in front of him, drawn more by forward momentum than by any desire to meet up with, or to avoid, her brother's latest best pal.<br><br>The cold wind made it difficult to breathe, as if it could snatch your next breath before you had time to swallow it, and she bent her head, too, hand to her hat, submerged in wind and beginning to imagine herself slowly losing ground with each step forward, slowly beginning to stall, and then to sail backward&#x2014;a quick scramble to regain ground and then another sailing backward. In church she had prayed for contentment. She was thirty, with no husband in sight. A good job, an aging father, a bachelor brother, a few nice friends. At least, she had asked&#x2014;so humbly, so earnestly, so seriously&#x2014;let me be content.<br><br>And now a slapstick windstorm fit for Harold Lloyd or Buster Keaton.<br><br>It was either God's reply or just April again, in the wind tunnel that was midtown Manhattan. The scent of it, the Easter scent of April in the city, all around her, in the cold air itself as well as on the shoulders of the crowd; the smell of sunlight and dirt, something warming at the heart of it all.<br><br>And then she felt his hand on her shoulder and he shouted, "Mary Rose," which bound him forever to her brother and her father and her life at home since nowhere else did she tolerate the double name. His head was still lowered, his hand still on his hat&#x2014;he might have been waiting for the right opportunity to doff it&#x2014;and he peered around at her from under its brim as if from under the rock of another life.<br><br>And she, her hand on the back of her own hat, did the same.<br><br>"Hello, George," she said. She could feel the crunch of city grit between her back teeth.<br><br>"Some wind," he said. He had one eye closed against it, the other was watery.<br><br>"You're telling me," she said.<br><br>They walked together to the corner and as they stepped off the curb, he suddenly reached up and took her raised elbow&#x2014;the one that led to the hand she held against her hat&#x2014;and kept it between his fingers as they crossed. She thought he must look like a man attached to a subway strap. At the next corner, he did the same; a gesture that was either brotherly or proprietary, but awkward either way, as if one of them were blind or doddering, or as if both were involved in some odd, raised-elbow folk dance. At Forty-sixth, the light was against them and the wind paused enough for her to take her hand off her hat while they waited with the crowd.<br><br>She turned to him&#x2014;was he going to speak? His eyes were teary from the wind, red-rimmed and bloodshot. His nose was running and there were tears on his windblown cheeks. She clicked open the purse that hung on her arm and found her handkerchief, but he refused it, reaching into his overcoat for his own. He mopped his face and blew his nose before the crowd got them moving again and as they got to the curb, she placed her left hand on her hat so he could reach her elbow at a more convenient angle&#x2014;which he did, guiding her across the street as if she were a novice pedestrian, and this time, perhaps, putting a little more pressure behind the fingertips that held her.<br><br>"Where are you headed, George?" she asked him. He shouted something unintelligible into the wind.<br><br>"Have you eaten yet?" she asked, because it was only polite. And then the wind paused completely, as it will in April, a sudden silence and maybe even the hint of warmth from the sun, so that he replied with odd gentleness, "Yeah, I had my lunch."<br><br>They were at the door of the restaurant. The wind was picking up again. "Would you like some coffee?" she asked.<br><br>He shook his head and she could not deny her own relief. "I'm out of time," he said. And then added, "What about dinner?"<br><br>"Lamb chops," she told him. "You coming over?" Anticipating already a stop at the butcher's to pick up two or three more.<br><br>He shook his head. There was another tear streaming down his windblown cheek and as he replied she lifted the handkerchief in her hand and wiped it away, feeling the not unpleasant pull of his beard against the thin cotton.<br><br>He said, "I mean, what about us having dinner?"<br><br>The wind puffed up again and they both put their hands to their hats. "Where?" she said, rudely, she realized later. But it was like having a passing stranger suddenly turn to sing you an aria. Anyone would have a second or two of not quite knowing what was really going on.<br><br>"Out," he told her. He was a broad-faced man who looked good in hats. Who looked better now than he did at home, where he had been thus far only the unremarkable source of her brother Jimmy's unpredictable enthusiasms. "At a restaurant," he said. And then to make himself clearer, "The two of us."<br><br>"Tonight?" she said, and then they both turned away for a moment from the peppered wind. When they turned back, he said, "Why not?" but without conviction, confirming for them both that this was a sudden impulse that most likely would not last out the afternoon. "What if I come by at seven?" he said.<br><br>She paused, squinting, not for the chance to see him better but for him to see her. "I'll have to cook those lamb chops anyway," she said. "Or else Jimmy and my father will be gnawing the table legs by the time I get home."<br><br>He smiled a little, unable to disguise what she was sure was a bit of confusion about his own impulse. He said again, "I'll come by at seven," and then turned back into the wind.<br><br>She pushed open the door to the restaurant. More lunchtime bustle, mostly women in hats with their coats thrown over the backs of chairs, the satiny linings and the fur collars and cuffs, the perfume and the elegant curves of the women's backs as they leaned forward across the small tables, all giving the hint of a boudoir to the busy place. She found a seat at the counter, wiggled her way into it. Saw the man beside her who was finishing a cigarette give her a quick up and down from over his shoulder and then turn back to flick an ash onto the remains of his sandwich. She imagined returning his dismissive stare, and then maybe even letting her eyes linger distastefully on the crust of bread and the bitten dill pickle and the cigarette debris on his plate. She could slide the ashtray that was right there between them a little closer to his elbow&#x2014;hint, hint. Emboldened, perhaps&#x2014;was she?&#x2014;by the fact that she'd just been asked out on a date.<br><br>She ordered a sandwich from the waitress, whose pretty youth was still evident in the doughy folds of her weary and aging face, and a cup of tea. And then she held her hands over the steaming water for a few seconds. Thin hands, long fingers, with a kind of transparency to the chapped skin. Her mother's gold ring, inset with a silver Miraculous Medal, on her right hand. The man beside her rubbed his cigarette into the plate, then stood, swinging away from her on the stool and causing a slight ripple through the customers all along the other side of him. He took his overcoat from the hat rack and put it on standing just behind her, and then leaned across his empty stool, brushing her arm, to leave a few coins under his plate.<br><br>"Overcoats in April," he said. "Some crazy weather."<br><br>She turned to him, out of politeness, the habit of it. "I've never seen such wind," she said.<br><br>He was handsome enough&#x2014;dark eyes and a nice chin, though his hair was thinning. He wore a dark overcoat and a dark suit, a white shirt and a tie, and there was the worn shine of a brass belt buckle as he reached for his wallet. "Reminds me of some days we had overseas," he said, taking a bill from his billfold.<br><br>She frowned, reflexively. "Where were you?"<br><br>He shook his head, smiled at her. Something in his manner seemed to indicate that they knew each other, that they'd had such conversations before. "In another life," he said and snapped the bill and slapped the wallet and returned it to his pocket with a wink that said, But all that's behind us now, isn't it? He was thin and his stomach was taut and his starched white shirt was smooth against his chest and belly. The brass belt buckle, marked with decorative lines, a circled initial at its center, was worn to a warm gold. "Once more into the breach," he said, turning up his collar. "Wish me luck."<br><br>For an odd second, she thought he might lean down and kiss her cheek.<br><br>"Good luck," she said. Over her shoulder, she watched him walk away. A slight limp, a favoring, perhaps, of his left leg. A flaw that would, she knew, diminish him in some women's eyes. Even <br>if he'd been wounded in the war, there would be, she knew, for some women, the diminished appeal of a man who had suffered something over which he'd had no control. Who had suffered disappointment.<br><br>She turned back to her sandwich. And here, of all things, was desire again. (She could have put the palm of her hand to the front of his white shirt.) Here was her chicken sandwich and her tea and the waitress with a hard life in her eyes and a pretty face disappearing into pale flesh asking if there's anything else for now, dear. Here was the boudoir air of respectable Schrafft's with its marble counters and pretty lamps and lunchtime bustle (ten minutes until she should be back at her desk), perfume and smoke, with the war over and another life begun and mad April whipping through the streets again. And here she was at thirty, just out of church (a candle lit every lunch hour, still, although the war was over), and yearning now with every inch of herself to put her hand to the worn buckle at a stranger's waist, a palm to his smooth belly. A man she'd never see again. Good luck.<br><br>She sipped her tea. Once, ten years ago, at a Sunday-afternoon party in some apartment that she remembered now as being laby-rinthine, although it probably had only four bedrooms, as opposed to the place she shared with her brother and her father that had two, Mike Shea had seized her by the wrist and pulled her into a dim room and plastered his mouth against hers before she could catch her breath. She had known him since high school, he was part of the crowd she went with then, and he had kissed her once or twice before&#x2014;she remembered specifically the train station at Fishkill, on a snowy night when they were all coming back from a sledding party&#x2014;but this was passionate and desperate, he was very drunk, and rough enough to make her push him off if he had not, in the first moment she had come up for air, gently taken off his glasses and placed them on a doilied dresser beside them, and then, in what seemed the same movement, reached behind her to lock the door. It was the odd, drunken gentleness of it, not to mention the snapping hint of danger from the lock, that changed her mind. And after two or three rebukes when he tried to get at the buttons that ran up the back of her dress, she thought, Why not, and although her acquiescence seemed to slow him down a bit, as if he was uncertain of the next step, she was enjoying herself enough by then to undo the last button without prompting and then to pull her bare shoulder and arm up out of the dress&#x2014;first one then the other&#x2014;and to pull dress and slip (she didn't wear a bra, no need) down to her waist in a single gesture. And then&#x2014;was it just the pleasure of the material against her bare flesh, his shirt front, her wool?&#x2014;she slowly pushed dress and slip and garter belt and stockings down over her narrow hips until they fell to her feet. And then she stepped out of her shoes. ("Even the shoes?" the priest had whispered in the confessional the following Saturday, as if it was more than he could bear, or imagine&#x2014;as if, she thought later, he was ready to send her to perdition or ask her for a date.)<br><br>The banging at the door was his excuse to turn away&#x2014;some people had their coats in there&#x2014;and while he stood with his back to her she dressed again and unlocked the door and walked out. She smiled at the taunts and jeers of her friends and when someone asked, "Where's Mike?" she said, "I think I killed him," which got a great laugh.<br><br>Mike Shea became a medic during the war and was now married, working for Pfizer. To this day he can't look at her straight. To this day she can't quite convince herself that the sin was as grave as it seemed. (She thought, in fact, of telling the priest as he whispered his furious admonitions that she weighed barely a hundred pounds and was as thin as a boy and if he would adjust his imagination accordingly and see the buds of her breasts and her flat stomach and the bony points of her hips, he would understand that even buck naked, her body was not made for mortal sin.)<br><br>She can't quite convince herself, these ten years later, that anything at all like it will happen to her again.<br><br>She finished her sandwich, gave an extra quarter to the waitress, who also wore no wedding band, and headed back into the breach.</p><h2>Why They Kill: The Discoveries of a Maverick Criminologist</h2><p>Richard Rhodes, Pulitzer Prize-winning author of <b>The Making of the Atomic Bomb</b>, brings his inimitable vision, exhaustive research, and mesmerizing prose to this timely book that dissects violence and offers new solutions to the age old problem of why people kill.<br><br>Lonnie Athens was raised by a brutally domineering father.&nbsp;&nbsp;Defying all odds, Athens became a groundbreaking criminologist who turned his scholar's eye to the problem of why people become violent.&nbsp;&nbsp;After a decade of interviewing several hundred violent convicts--men and women of varied background and ethnicity, he discovered "violentization," the four-stage process by which almost any human being can evolve into someone who will assault, rape, or murder another human being.&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Why They Kill</b> is a riveting biography of Athens and a judicious critique of his seminal work, as well as an unflinching investigation into the history of violence.</p><p>In <i>Why They Kill</i>, Pulitzer Prize winner Richard Rhodes traces the life and career of criminologist Lonnie Athens, a man who took his own sad and squalid life and turned it on its head to make a groundbreaking career as a criminologist. Athens grew up in a violent, angry world. Rather than absorbing the sickness and violence around him, though, he studied it, and eventually developed a theory about how violent criminals are created. Rhodes's critical examination of Athens's work forces readers to consider how violent our society really is, how it became that way, and what might be done to change it. When applied to well-known criminals such as Michael Tyson and Lee Harvey Oswald, Athens's ideas become concrete and take on an urgent tone: it's easy to discuss theories and predictors in the abstract, but these stories are real, and they repeat themselves in our society at an alarming rate. Rhodes's approach to this disturbing subject stands apart from many other crime books in its intelligence, humanity, and empathy. These are not just descriptions of "scumbags" and their brutal crimes, but intensely personal stories that reveal how a culture of violence propagates itself. <i>--Lisa Higgins</i><br>A conversation with Richard Rhodes, author of <b>Why They Kill</b><br><br><b>Q:</b> What is <b>Why They Kill</b> about?<br><b>A:</b> <b>Why They Kill</b> reports and extends the breakthrough work of the American criminologist Dr. Lonnie Athens, who has discovered through in-depth interviews with several hundred violent criminals what causes people to become seriously violent -- to commit murder, rape and violent assault. <br><br><b>Q:</b> Are violent people crazy?<br><b>A:</b> No. Most of the violent criminals Dr. Athens studied were not mentally ill. Most people who are mentally ill are not violent, and if they are, it isn't because they're mentally ill. People confuse violence with mental illness because violence is unusual in a civil society and seems self-defeating and "out of control." The violent don't see it that way.<br> People also confuse violence with mental illness because some mental health professionals believe violent behavior by itself, without other indications of pathology, is a sign of mental illness. It's an old belief, going back to 19th-century medicine. There has never been good evidence to support it.<br><br><b>Q:</b> Then what makes people violent?<br><b>A:</b> Dr. Athens found that people become violent by undergoing a series of intense, noxious social experiences (usually during childhood and early adolescence, but sometimes after they become adults) that lead them to believe that serious violence is the best way to protect themselves, to punish people they perceive to be evil, and to get what they want.<br><br><b>Q:</b> What are these noxious social experiences?<br><b>A:</b> Every dangerous violent criminal Dr. Athens studied -- but not battered women and not ordinary criminals -- had fully experienced and completed a four-stage process of social development that he calls "violentization" ("violent socialization"):<br> First, brutalization: using physical and/or psychological violence, a violent authority figure forces the novice to submit to his authority ("violent subjugation"); the novice witnesses the violent subjugation of people close to him ("personal horrification"); and one or more authority figures coach him in his personal responsibility to use violence to settle disputes ("violent coaching").<br> Second, belligerency: After fully experiencing brutalization, the dispirited novice, determined to avoid a lifetime of violent subjugation, heeds his violent coaching and undergoes a conversion-like experience, resolving to resort to all necessary violence the next time someone seriously provokes him.<br> Third, violent performances: The converted novice emerges victorious from a violent encounter and discovers that as a consequence, others now respect and fear him. In further violent performances he widens the range of situations where he's willing to use violence.<br> Fourth, virulency: Exultant, the violent actor now commits himself to a deeper and more permanent resolution to use serious violence with little or no provocation as a means of dealing with people -- and bonds with others who believe as he does.<br><br><b>Q:</b> People don't really decide to use violence, do they? Don't they just snap?<br><b>A:</b> One of Dr. Athens's most important findings is that violence is a decision, not an explosion. People who have been exposed to violence usually understand that violent people choose to use violence (and are therefore responsible for their acts), but psychiatry and criminology have long argued otherwise. The violent men and women Dr. Athens interviewed consistently described an assessment process that led them to decide to use violence. Even extremely violent people only use violence when they feel it's appropriate. They may exclude family members, for example. They consider the risk to themselves of being seriously injured or killed and the risk of being caught. With experience, they learn to make such decisions quickly, which may be why mental-health professionals with little personal experience of violence call such decisions "impulsive." Dr. Athens found that violent people often change their minds about initiating a violent attack, usually when the risk factors change. That's incontrovertible evidence <br>that they are making decisions and not merely acting on impulse.<br> People who have not experienced serious violence may not realize that the violent perpetrator puts himself at risk when he attacks someone. A violent perpetrator who decides to kill someone knows very well that his intended victim is likely to put up a defense. That can be dangerous. Putting your life at risk isn't something anyone does on impulse.<br><br><b>Q.</b> Does violence in the media cause violent behavior?<br><b>A:</b> Despite all the millions of dollars spent looking for a connection between media violence and violent behavior, no causal connection has ever been shown. The studies that supposedly show a connection between media violence and violent behavior have been statistical studies. They identify correlations -- risk factors -- not causes. Media violence studies have found only slight correlations. There have not been correlations between media violence and criminally violent behavior but only between exposure to media violence and, for example, reported increased feelings of anger after such exposure, or playing a game more aggressively, or increased willingness to inflate a blood-pressure cuff to the point of causing someone pain. These correlations supposedly measure what the researchers call "aggression"; they do not measure serious violence. Longer-term studies discover differences such as playground behavior changes over a period of months, but they have no way of sorting out violent media exposure from other influences that might cause such changes.<br> Media violence may well make some people feel more aggressive, but there's no evidence whatsoever that such feelings cause violent behavior. Surveys of juvenile offenders, including violent offenders, find no difference in their television and movie viewing habits compared to juvenile non-offenders.<br><br><b>Q.</b> What about genetic factors as a cause of violent behavior? Are people born violent?<br><b>A.</b> There are only very minor differences genetically among all the different racial and ethnic groups that make up the human race. So if there were a gene for violence you would expect all human groups to show similar levels of violent behavior. In fact homicide rates have differed greatly at different times and places, in different cultures, within and between different ethnic groups and in different centuries. Homicide rates in preliterate indigenous societies (such as the Yanamomo of Brazil or the Highland societies of Papua New Guinea) were and are consistently ten to a hundred times higher than in modern civil societies. Homicide rates in Europe and Japan are much lower than in the United States. Obviously people aren't born violent. They learn to be violent through social experiences.<br><br><b>Q.</b> Can violent people be cured?<br><b>A.</b> Once people have completed violentization -- once they have begun to use serious violence against other people with little or no provocation -- no one, including Dr. Athens, has found a way to de-escalate their violent behavior. That's not surprising, since violence pays powerful dividends from the violent person's point of view: it reduces his risk of being violently dominated, rewards him with violent notoriety and enables him to dominate others. Since most acts of criminal violence are committed by young people between the ages of fifteen and thirty, it does appear that violent people decide to use violence less frequently as they get older. Since there is no known cure for violent criminality, <b>Why They Kill</b> endorses a public policy of selective incarceration: focusing scarce public resources on identifying the most seriously violent offenders, prosecuting them and incarcerating them under long prison sentences without parole.<br> But the most important consequence of Dr. Athens's work is that it offers solid scientific evidence to support programs of violence prevention. If a violent novice must fully experience and complete all four stages of violentization to become a dangerous violent criminal, then intervening at any point along the way should prevent that destructive outcome. Preventing child abuse and violent domination, sheltering and protecting battered spouses, teaching negotiation skills to counter violent coaching, giving belligerent children counseling and better alternatives rather than simply expelling them from school, punishing initial violent performances to make sure their perpetrators consider them defeats rather than victories -- these and other interventions can prevent violent novices from becoming full-blown violent criminals.<br><br><b>Q.</b> What can parents do?<br><b>A.</b> First, stop worrying about media violence making their children violent. It doesn't. Second, make sure that their children are not being brutalized by family members, at school, in gangs or on the streets. If they are, they're likely to show traumatic stress disturbances -- anxiety, avoidance, disturbed sleep, depression, inappropriate anger -- if not actual physical injury. Third, recognize that violence is a community problem for which community members bear personal responsibility. Bystanders encourage violent behavior, because violent people take indifference or neutrality for endorsement. Violentization can be prevented or interrupted. Many people believe they have a right to attack people physically who unduly provoke them, especially their spouses and children. Parents and other citizens need to identify and support school and community programs -- there are many -- designed to exemplify and teach nonviolent alternatives to bullying and violent disputes, violentization. Such experience calls for <br>immediate intervention, which will be more effective if the violent young person has suffered a defeat. At this point, he needs resocialization into a nonviolent primary group. Wildcat High School in the Bronx attempts to do that with violent and potentially violent students. The Menninger Peaceful Schools Project uses defensive martial arts training, which incorporates an ethical code of gentleness and compassion, to teach young people nonviolent values.<br> Unfortunately, once someone has committed a serious act of violence, signalling virulency, official intervention may add to his violent notoriety and increase his commitment to violence. No one has discovered how to reverse virulency in a dangerous violent criminal. Until such understanding is available, society has little choice but to segregate violent criminals from other people.<br> The best way to prevent the development of dangerous violent criminals is to prevent the brutalization of children. The United States is losing that battle. The number of children killed by abuse has increased by fifty percent in the past decade. A 1998 Gallup poll found that almost five percent of U.S. parents report punishing their children by punching, kicking, throwing them down or hitting them with a belt, hairbrush, stick or some other hard object elsewhere than on the bottom -- a percentage that corresponds to some three million children. Parents also reported that 1.3 million of their children had been sexually abused within the past twelve months. In another study of teenage boys and girls commissioned by Children Now, a child advocacy group, and Kaiser Permanente, a health-care company, forty percent of teenage girls reported having a friend their own age who had been hit or beaten by a boyfriend. More than twenty-five percent of teenage boys reported having a friend who had been a victim of gang violence; almost half had a friend who had been threatened with a weapon.</p><h2>A Cold Blooded Business</h2><p>KATE SHUGAK is a native Aleut working as a private investigator in Alaska.

In 1992, the first in the series, A Cold Day for Murder, received an Edgar Award from the Crime Writers of America.Stabenow's hardcover debut marks the fourth outing for Kate Shugak (last seen in Dead in the Water ), a native Aleut who is building a solid reputation as a tough freelance investigator. Although Kate has no love for the oil companies drilling in Alaska, she accepts a commission from Royal Petroleum Co. to find out who is bringing drugs into the Prudhoe Bay work site where there have been several overdoses and one death. Over the objections of RPetCo's security chief, Lou Childress, Kate goes in as an employee, getting a good look at her surroundings as a driver for Toni Hartzler, who gives PR tours to visiting dignitaries. She gains an instant "in" with the locals when she encounters Jerry McIsaac, an old acquaintance who works there as a medic. Kate spots plenty of drugs at her first party but doesn't observe anyone dealing. Of equal interest to her are the Native American artifacts being unearthed by archeologists at a local dig. While Kate is getting caught up in artifacts, she fails to notice that the dealers themselves are playing sleuth, putting her in danger. Throughout, Stabenow makes effective use of the regional setting, culture and Kate's personal heritage to add depth and color to this brisk and thoughtful tale.

Since many such attacks&#x2014;including, of course, those of September 11, 2001&#x2014;have been perpetrated by Muslim terrorists professing religious motives, it might seem obvious that Islamic fundamentalism is the central cause. This presumption has fueled the belief that future 9/11&#x2019;s can be avoided only by a wholesale transformation of Muslim societies, a core reason for broad public support in the United States for the recent conquest of Iraq.<br><br> However, the presumed connection between suicide terrorism and Islamic fundamentalism is misleading and may be encouraging domestic and foreign policies likely to worsen America&#x2019;s situation and to harm many Muslims needlessly.<br><br> I have compiled a database of every suicide bombing and attack around the globe from 1980 through 2003&#x2014;315 attacks in all.1 It includes every attack in which at least one terrorist killed himself or herself while attempting to kill others; it excludes attacks authorized by a national government, for example by North Korea against the South. This database is the first complete universe of suicide terrorist attacks worldwide. I have amassed and independently verified all the relevant information that could be found in English and other languages (for example, Arabic, Hebrew, Russian, and Tamil) in print and on-line. The information is drawn from suicide terrorist groups themselves, from the main organizations that collect such data in target countries, and from news media around the world. More than a &#x201c;list of lists,&#x201d; this database probably represents the most comprehensive and reliable survey of suicide terrorist attacks that is now available.<br><br> The data show that there is little connection between suicide terrorism and Islamic fundamentalism, or any one of the world&#x2019;s religions. In fact, the leading instigators of suicide attacks are the Tamil Tigers in Sri Lanka, a Marxist-Leninist group whose members are from Hindu families but who are adamantly opposed to religion. This group committed 76 of the 315 incidents, more suicide attacks than Hamas.<br><br> Rather, what nearly all suicide terrorist attacks have in common is a specific secular and strategic goal: to compel modern democracies to withdraw military forces from territory that the terrorists consider to be their homeland. Religion is rarely the root cause, although it is often used as a tool by terrorist organizations in recruiting and in other efforts in service of the broader strategic objective.<br><br> Three general patterns in the data support my conclusions. First, nearly all suicide terrorist attacks occur as part of organized campaigns, not as isolated or random incidents. Of the 315 separate attacks in the period I studied, 301 could have their roots traced to large, coherent political or military campaigns.<br><br> Second, democratic states are uniquely vulnerable to suicide terrorists. The United States, France, India, Israel, Russia, Sri Lanka, and Turkey have been the targets of almost every suicide attack of the past two decades, and each country has been a democracy at the time of the incidents.<br><br> Third, suicide terrorist campaigns are directed toward a strategic objective. From Lebanon to Israel to Sri Lanka to Kashmir to Chechnya, the sponsors of every campaign have been terrorist groups trying to establish or maintain political self-determination by compelling a democratic power to withdraw from the territories they claim. Even al-Qaeda fits this pattern: although Saudi Arabia is not under American military occupation per se, a principal objective of Osama bin Laden is the expulsion of American troops from the Persian Gulf and the reduction of Washington&#x2019;s power and influence in the region.<br><br> Understanding suicide terrorism is essential for the promotion of American security and international peace after September 11, 2001. On that day, nineteen al-Qaeda terrorists hijacked four airlines and destroyed the World Trade Center towers and part of the Pentagon, killing nearly 3,000 innocent people. This episode awakened Americans and the world to a new fear that previously we had barely imagined: that even at home in the United States, we were vulnerable to devastating attack by determined terrorists, willing to die to kill us.<br><br> What made the September 11 attack possible&#x2014;and so unexpected and terrifying&#x2014;was that willingness to die to accomplish the mission. The final instructions found in the luggage of several hijackers leave little doubt about their intentions, telling them to make<br><br> an oath to die. . . . When the confrontation begins, strike like champions who do not want to go back to this world. . . . Check your weapons long before you leave . . . you must make your knife sharp and must not discomfort your animal during the slaughter. . . . Afterwards, we will all meet in the highest heaven. . . .2<br><br> The hijackers&#x2019; suicide was essential to the terrible lethality of the attack, making it possible to crash airplanes into populated buildings. It also created an element of surprise, allowing the hijackers to exploit the counterterrorism measures and mind-set that had evolved to deal with ordinary terrorist threats. Perhaps most jarring, the readiness of the terrorists to die in order to kill Americans amplified our sense of vulnerability. After September 11, Americans know that we must expect that future al-Qaeda or other anti-American terrorists may be equally willing to die, and so not deterred by fear of punishment or of anything else. Such attackers would not hesitate to kill more Americans, and could succeed in carrying out equally devastating attacks&#x2014;or worse&#x2014;despite our best efforts to stop them.<br><br> September 11 was monstrous and shocking in scale, but it was not fundamentally unique. For more than twenty years, terrorist groups have been increasingly relying on suicide attacks to achieve major political objectives. From 1980 to 2003, terrorists across the globe waged seventeen separate campaigns of suicide terrorism, including those by Hezbollah to drive the United States, French, and Israeli forces out of Lebanon; by Palestinian terrorist groups to force Israel to abandon the West Bank and Gaza; by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (the &#x201c;Tamil Tigers&#x201d;) to compel the Sri Lankan government to accept an independent Tamil homeland; by al-Qaeda to pressure the United States to withdraw from the Persian Gulf region. Since August of 2003, an eighteenth campaign has begun, aimed at driving the United States out of Iraq; as of this writing, it is not yet clear how much this effort owes to indigenous forces and how much to foreigners, possibly including al-Qaeda.<br><br> More worrying, the raw number of suicide terrorist attacks is climbing. At the same time that terrorist incidents of all types have declined by nearly half, from a peak of 666 in 1987 to 348 in 2001, suicide terrorism has grown, and the trend is continuing. Suicide terrorist attacks have risen from an average of three per year in the 1980s to about ten per year in the 1990s to more than forty each year in 2001 and 2002, and nearly fifty in 2003. These include continuing campaigns by Palestinian groups against Israel and by al-Qaeda and Taliban-related forces in Saudi Arabia and Afghanistan, as well as at least twenty attacks in Iraq against U.S. troops, the United Nations, and Iraqis collaborating with the American occupation.<br><br> Although many Americans have hoped that al-Qaeda has been badly weakened by U.S. counterterrorism efforts since September 11, 2001, the data show otherwise. In 2002 and 2003, al-Qaeda conducted fifteen suicide terrorist attacks, more than in all the years before September 11 combined, killing 439 people.<br><br> Perhaps most worrying of all, suicide terrorism has become the most deadly form of terrorism. Suicide attacks amount to just 3 percent of all terrorist incidents from 1980 through 2003, but account for 48 percent of all fatalities, making the average suicide terrorist attack twelve times deadlier than other forms of terrorism&#x2014;even if the immense losses of September 11 are not counted.3 If a terrorist group does get its hands on a nuclear weapon, suicide attack is the best way to ensure the bomb will go off and the most troublesome scenario for its use.<br><br> Since September 11, 2001, the United States has responded to the growing threat of suicide terrorism by embarking on a policy to conquer Muslim countries&#x2014;not simply rooting out existing havens for terrorists in Afghanistan but going further to remake Muslim societies in the Persian Gulf. To be sure, the United States must be ready to use force to protect Americans and their allies and must do so when necessary. However, the close association between foreign military occupations and the growth of suicide terrorist movements in the occupied regions should make us hesitate over any strategy centering on the transformation of Muslim societies by means of heavy military power. Although there may still be good reasons for such a strategy, we should recognize that the sustained presence of heavy American combat forces in Muslim countries is likely to increase the odds of the next 9/11.<br><br> To win the war on terrorism, we must have a new conception of victory. The key to lasting security lies not only in rooting out today&#x2019;s generation of terrorists who are actively planning to kill Americans, but also in preventing the next, potentially larger generation from rising up. America&#x2019;s overarching purpose must be to achieve the first goal without failing at the second. To achieve that purpose, it is essential that we understand the strategic, social, and individual logic of suicide terrorism.<br><br> Our enemies have been studying suicide terrorism for over twenty years. Now is the time to level the playing field.</p><h2>Thank You Notes</h2><p>Jimmy Fallon is very thankful.

He was never the same afterward. Legend has it that the hideous author now lurks in the dark forests outside Austin, Texas, along with his beastly wife and toothy twin cubs.K-Gr 2&#x2014;In this fiendishly fun novelty book, Master Edgar Dreadbury is suitably bored by typical Halloween attire and chooses to bypass his usual costume store for The Monster Shop, which he had not previously noticed. There, he finds a contraption called the "MONSTERATOR," and with a nonchalant "Oh, why not," the child drops his dime into the old fashioned-looking machine and is suddenly transformed into a monster. With his fearsome roar, sharp fangs, pointy horns, and reptilian feet, Edgar joyfully scares everyone in his path. "He horrified the tall./He terrified the small./Edgar Dreadbury frightened them all." It's all well and good on Halloween night, but when Edgar grows tired of being a monster, he discovers that the shop has disappeared and he is destined to remain one forever. The simple plot is heightened by a humorous rhyming text (including many monsterly sound effects) and large, kid-friendly, digitally enhanced acrylic illustrations that are more funny than creepy. But the true pleasure and surprise of this book are the final pages that serve as a flip toy, allowing youngsters to "monsterate" Edgar themselves by selecting from several layers of monstrous heads, faces, bodies, and feet. Sturdy pages will survive dozens of flips and give kids lots of incentive to create their own Halloween costume mash-ups.

When three young wizards-in-training get kidnapped by the evil queen of the land, it is up to their familiars to go a dangerous journey to rescue them. You&#39;ll meet Aldwyn, an orphan alley cat pretending to have telekinesis; Skylar, a know-it-all blue jay who can cast illusions; and Gilbert, a hapless tree frog with the ability to see visions of the future in pools of water. See what happens when these three animal assistants -- typically relegated to the background or found sitting quietly on their wizard&#39;s shoulders -- go on a heroic adventure of their own!</p><p>One of the unique things about this book is that we co-authored it. The two of us literally sat in the same room for months and months writing every word, sentence, and paragraph together. Andrew is the typist (because he&#39;s frankly a much faster typer), while Adam sits beside him, or across from him in a nice, comfy chair, or sometimes paces around. Neither one of us were English majors in college or had any book writing experience previously, but we&#39;ve both read a lot, watched a lot, and lived inside our imaginations since we were little kids. Andrew played with his Star Wars and GI Joe action figures for hours on end as a kid (probably until he was way too old to be playing with them), and Adam grew up on Dungeons and Dragons and video games and comic books. Writing fantasy is like bringing all of those childhood daydreams to life, and the best part is, it&#39;s our job!Running to save his life, Aldwyn, the street-wise orphan alley cat, ducks into a strange store. Moments later Jack, a young wizard-in-training, comes in to pick out his familiar - a magical animal companion. Aldwyn's&nbsp;always been clever.&nbsp;But magical?

He graduated from Yeshiva University and the Jewish Theological Seminary of America, was ordained as a rabbi, and earned his PhD in philosophy from the University of Pennsylvania. He also served as editor of the Jewish Publication Society of America. Potok&#x2019;s first novel,&nbsp;<i>The Chosen</i>,&nbsp;published in 1967, received the Edward Lewis Wallant Memorial Book Award and was nominated for the National Book Award. He is author of eight novels, including&nbsp;<i>In the Beginning&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>My Name Is Asher Lev</i>,&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Wanderings</i>, a history of the Jews. He died in 2002.1<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> During the last retreat, when the Chinese and the army of the North swept down into the South, an old man and his wife fled from their village in the hills and embarked upon a panicky trek along the main road to Seoul and at one point scrambled with other refugees into a roadside ditch to avoid an approaching column of American tanks and jeeps. There they came upon the boy.<br> &nbsp;<br> The old man glanced at the boy: blood-covered, barely breathing, lying face-up and unconscious in the snow in the bottom of the ditch. He looked indifferently away.<br> &nbsp;<br> Two jet fighters swept past overhead, low. The steel-treaded thunder of the tanks; the trembling of the earth. Soil along both sides of the ditch cascaded upon the old man and the woman and the boy.<br> &nbsp;<br> The old man thought matter-of-factly: This ditch will be my grave.<br> &nbsp;<br> Shells exploded close by. A stench of cordite filled the air. Something moist and cold fell upon the old man&#x2019;s face. He reached up to brush it away and saw it was a hand and thought it was a hand of a body blown to pieces, and his skin crawled. But it was the hand of the boy.<br> &nbsp;<br> Lying on his back in the ditch, his head in snow to his ears, the boy had waked to semi-consciousness.<br> &nbsp;<br> The old man looked a long moment into the boy&#x2019;s dark beseeching eyes and spoke briefly to his wife.<br> &nbsp;<br> She opened the boy&#x2019;s shirt and gazed at the wound: a shrapnel gash below the right collarbone, the sliver of metal showing darkly, the wound oozing blood. A piece of the scale from the dragon of death. Remove it.<br> &nbsp;<br> The last of the tanks had gone. On the road now were American and Korean foot soldiers. The refugees began to climb from the ditch. Townspeople and farmers and villagers. From the valleys to the north. Possessions on shoulders and heads and in carts. Infants carried on the backs of older children. Old women straddling the backs of middle-aged men. All begrimed, terrified.<br> &nbsp;<br> Two carts had been sideswiped by passing vehicles and men were lifting them out of the ditch. An ox lay dead in the ditch, still harnessed to its ruined cart. Vapor rose from its mouth and hindquarters. The old man could see no wound. Dead, how? The heart abruptly ceasing? He had seen it before: an ox plowing and suddenly faltering, lurching to its knees, and collapsing onto the furrowed earth. And the day the carpenter&#x2019;s younger brother lifted a house beam to his shoulder and fell lifeless to the ground. Alive one moment, the next moment dead. You can&#x2019;t help it.<br> &nbsp;<br> The old man climbed out of the ditch. Their cart stood on the edge of the road, where they had left it. The bright sharp morning air was wind-whipped and bitter cold.<br> &nbsp;<br> The woman remained in the ditch beside the boy. The man looked around. The once-frozen road had been ground to powder by the steel-cleated tracked vehicles. A cloud of yellow dust hung over it like a fog. On both sides of the road were terraced fields bordered by wild winter grass and tall hills. No human sounds came from the road: only the clanking scraping leathery noises of the marching men and the creaking of the two-wheeled carts and the occasional bellow of an ox.<br> &nbsp;<br> The old man turned impatiently and called to the woman, but she would not move. The ditch lay deep and empty save for the woman and the boy and the tawny-skinned dead ox attached to its wrecked cart.<br> &nbsp;<br> He called again to the woman. She looked up and down the empty ditch and then at her husband. She pointed to the boy, who had again lost consciousness and now lay with his head in her lap.<br> &nbsp;<br> The man saw that her skirt was stained with the boy&#x2019;s blood and he began to shout at her in anger but his words were cut off by the sudden chop and beat of a helicopter swooping in from the south and flying so low he could see the pale helmeted face of the man inside. He put his hands to his ears. Air vibrated inside his throat and head. When he looked again at the ditch he saw his wife trying to climb out, carrying the boy.<br> &nbsp;<br> Angry, he took the boy from her, and was momentarily thrown off balance by his lightness. Like a small bird. He laid him down on the pile of quilts in the cart. The woman made her own way out of the ditch.<br> &nbsp;<br> He thought he would take some flesh from the dead ox. It would soon be stripped clean, why not take some part of it? One of the legs perhaps. But the woman was talking to him about the boy.<br> &nbsp;<br> He looked at the dead ox. Two men were already cutting it with their knives. Left behind, why? Diseased? But one can burn away disease over an open fire. Abandon a dead ox. This war made people crazy.<br> &nbsp;<br> The boy lay in the cart, on the quilts. The woman stood beside the cart wiping the filth of the ditch from his face and looking at the sliver of metal embedded in his chest. The wound seemed deep, the flesh inflamed. She remembered hearing from the carpenter that such wounds should quickly be brought to one skilled in hospital medicine. She leaned over the side of the cart, trying to stanch the flow of blood with cloth she had torn from her skirt.<br> &nbsp;<br> The old man took up the shafts of the cart and moved into the line of refugees. Her eyes upon the boy, the woman walked alongside the cart.<br> &nbsp;<br> As they passed the ox the old man saw five men now sundering it. Because of the boy he could take nothing from that ox. His own ox he had not brought with them, because he feared he could not feed it in flight; he had left it in the shed with an open sack of grain. He did not think it would live long or that their village would survive this attack. It was said the Chinese looted everything and what they could not carry away they burned. He and his wife in their haste to flee the village had taken only their quilts and sleeping pads and the box containing the spirit of his father and enough food to feed themselves for a few days.<br> &nbsp;<br> Around a curve they went by an elderly man lying on his back on the side of the road. Eyes and mouth black holes. Dead a long time. The line of men and women and children moved imperturbably past him.<br> &nbsp;<br> The old man walked as if hitched to the shafts of the cart. They would bring the boy to a hospital somewhere or to an orphanage and move on. Probably he would die first. Then they would leave him on the side of the road. The land was filled with orphans. They roamed the hills and valleys like packs of wild dogs, stealing, scavenging, plundering. Obstinate old woman. Why did they need now upon their backs the additional burden of a strange boy?<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Zenana: Everyday Peace in a Karachi Apartment Building</h2><p><p>Ethnic violence is a widespread concern, but we know very little about the micro-mechanics of coexistence in the neighborhoods around the world where inter-group peace is maintained amidst civic strife. In this ethnographic study of a multi-ethnic, middle-class high-rise apartment building in Karachi, Pakistan, Laura A. Ring argues that peace is the product of a relentless daily labor, much of it carried out in the zenana, or women&#x2019;s space. Everyday rhythms of life in the building are shaped by gender, ethnic and rural/urban tensions, national culture, and competing interpretations of Islam. Women&#x2019;s exchanges between households&#x2015;visiting, borrowing, helping&#x2015;and management of male anger are forms of creative labor that regulate and make sense of ethnic differences. Linking psychological senses of "tension" with anthropological views of the social significance of exchange, Ring argues that social-cultural tension is not so much resolved as borne and sustained by women&#x2019;s practices. Framed by a vivid and highly personal narrative of the author&#x2019;s interactions with her neighbors, her Pakistani in-laws, and other residents of the city, Zenana provides a rare glimpse into contemporary urban life in a Muslim society.</p></p><p>A rare, intimate glimpse into the daily lives of middle-class women in urban Pakistan.<p>Laura A.

I was induced to do this for two reasons: one, that it enabled me to get a good look at his bent, concentrated face, and the other, that it seemed to indicate my reverence for his superhuman insight. So absorbed was he even then, in tracking some mysterious clue, that he did not seem to notice me. But therein I was wrong &#x2014; as I always was in my attempt to understand that powerful intellect.<br><br>'It is raining,' he said, without lifting his head.<br><br>'You have been out, then?' I said quickly.<br><br>'No. But I see that your umbrella is wet, and that your overcoat has drops of water on it.'<br><br>I sat aghast at his penetration. After a pause he said carelessly, as if dismissing the subject: 'Besides, I hear the rain on the window. Listen.'<br><br>I listened. I could scarcely credit my ears, but there was the soft pattering of drops on the panes. It was evident there was no deceiving this man!<br><br>'Have you been busy lately?' I asked, changing the subject. 'What new problem &#x2014; given up by Scotland Yard as inscrutable &#x2014; has occupied that gigantic intellect?'<br><br>He drew back his foot slightly, and seemed to hesitate ere he returned it to its original position. Then he answered wearily: 'Mere trifles &#x2014; nothing to speak of. The Prince Kupoli has been here to get my advice regarding the disappearance of certain rubies from the Kremlin; the Rajah of Pootibad, after vainly beheading his entire bodyguard, has been obliged to seek my assistance to recover a jeweled sword. The Grand Duchess of Pretzel-Brauntswig is desirous of discovering where her husband was on the night of February 14; and last night &#x2014; he lowered his voice slightly &#x2014;'a lodger in this very house, meeting me on the stairs, wanted to know why they didn't answer his bell.'<br><br>I could not help smiling &#x2013; until I saw a frown gathering on his inscrutable forehead.<br><br>'Pray remember,' he said coldly, 'that it was through such an apparently trivial question that I found out Why Paul Ferroll Killed His Wife, and What Happened to Jones!'<br><br>I became dumb at once. He paused for a moment, and then suddenly changing back to his usual pitiless, analytical style, he said: 'When I say these are trifles, they are so in comparison to an affair that is now before me. A crime has been committed, &#x2013; and, singularly enough, against myself. You start,' he said. 'You wonder who would have dared to attempt it. So did I; nevertheless, it has been done. <i>I</i> have been <i>robbed</i> !'<br><br>'You robbed! You, Hemlock Jones, the Terror of Peculators!'I gasped in amazement, arising and gripping the table as I faced him.<br><br>'Yes! Listen. I would confess it to no other. But you who have followed my career, who know my methods; you, for whom I have partly lifted the veil that conceals my plans from ordinary humanity, &#x2014; you, who have for years rapturously accepted my confidences, passionately admired my inductions and inferences, placed yourself at my beck and call, become my slave, groveled at my feet, given up your practice except those few unremunerative and rapidly decreasing patients to whom, in moments of abstraction over my problems, you have administered strychnine for quinine and arsenic for Epsom salts; you, who have sacrificed anything and everybody to me, &#x2014; you I make my confidant!'<br><br>I arose and embraced him warmly, yet he was already so engrossed in thought that at the same moment he mechanically placed his hand upon his watch chain as if to consult the time. 'Sit down,' he said. 'Have a cigar?'<br><br>'I have given up cigar smoking,' I said.<br><br>'Why?' he asked.<br><br>I hesitated, and perhaps colored. I had really given it up because, with my diminished practice, it was too expensive. I could afford only a pipe. 'I prefer a pipe,' I said laughingly.'But tell me of this robbery. What have you lost?'<br><br>He arose, and planting himself before the fire with his hands under his coat-tails, looked down upon me reflectively for a moment. 'Do you remember the cigar case presented to me by the Turkish Ambassador for discovering the missing favorite of the Grand Vizier in the fifth chorus girl at the Hilarity Theatre? It was that one. I mean the cigar case. It was incrusted with diamonds.'<br><br>'And the largest one had been supplanted by paste,' I said.<br><br>'Ah,' he said, with a reflective smile, 'you know that?'<br><br>'You told me yourself. I remember considering it a proof of your extraordinary perception. But, by Jove, you don't mean to say you have lost it?'<br><br>He was silent for a moment. 'No; it has been stolen, it is true, but I shall still find it. And by myself alone! In your profession, my dear fellow, when a member is seriously ill, he does not prescribe for himself, but calls in a brother doctor. Therein we differ. I shall take this matter in my own hands.'<br><br>'And where could you find better?' I said enthusiastically.'I should say the cigar case is as good as recovered already.'<br><br>'I shall remind you of that again,' he said lightly. 'And now, to show you my confidence in your judgment, in spite of my determination to pursue this alone, I am willing to listen to any suggestions from you.'<br><br>He drew a memorandum book from his pocket and, with a grave smile, took up his pencil.<br><br>I could scarcely believe my senses. He, the great Hemlock Jones, accepting suggestions from a humble individual like myself ! I kissed his hand reverently, and began in a joyous tone:<br><br>'First, I should advertise, offering a reward; I should give the same intimation in handbills, distributed at the ''pubs''and the pastry-cooks'. I should next visit the different pawnbrokers; I should give notice at the police station. I should examine the servants. I should thoroughly search the house and my own pockets. I speak relatively,' I added, with a laugh. 'Of course I mean your own.'<br><br>He gravely made an entry of these details.<br><br>'Perhaps,' I added, 'you have already done this?'<br><br>'Perhaps,' he returned enigmatically.<br><br>'Now, my dear friend,' he continued, putting the notebook in his pocket and rising, 'would you excuse me for a few moments? Make yourself perfectly at home until I return; there may be some things,' he added with a sweep of his hand toward his heterogeneously filled shelves, 'that may interest you and while away the time. There are pipes and tobacco in that corner.'<br><br>Then nodding to me with the same inscrutable face he left the room. I was too well accustomed to his methods to think much of his unceremonious withdrawal, and made no doubt he was off to investigate some clue which had suddenly occurred to his active intelligence.<br><br>Left to myself I cast a cursory glance over his shelves. There were a number of small glass jars containing earthy substances, labeled 'Pavement and Road Sweepings,' from the principal thoroughfares and suburbs of London, with the sub-directions 'for identifying foot-tracks.' There were several other jars, labeled 'Fluff from Omnibus and Road Car Seats,' 'Cocoanut Fibre and Rope Strands from Mattings in Public Places,' 'Cigarette Stumps and Match Ends from Floor of Palace Theatre, Row A, 1 to 50.' Everywhere were evidences of this wonderful man's system and perspicacity.<br><br>I was thus engaged when I heard the slight creaking of a door, and I looked up as a stranger entered. He was a rough-looking man, with a shabby overcoat and a still more disreputable muffler around his throat and the lower part of his face. Considerably annoyed at his intrusion, I turned upon him rather sharply, when, with a mumbled, growling apology for mistaking the room, he shuffled out again and closed the door. I followed him quickly to the landing and saw that he disappeared down the stairs. With my mind full of the robbery, the incident made a singular impression upon me. I knew my friend's habit of hasty absences from his room in his moments of deep inspiration; it was only too probable that, with his powerful intellect and magnificent perceptive genius concentrated on one subject, he should be careless of his own belongings, and no doubt even forget to take the ordinary precaution of locking up his drawers. I tried one or two and found that I was right, although for some reason I was unable to open one to its fullest extent. The handles were sticky, as if some one had opened them with dirty fingers. Knowing Hemlock's fastidious cleanliness, I resolved to inform him of this circumstance, but I forgot it, alas! until &#x2013; but I am anticipating my story.<br><br>His absence was strangely prolonged. I at last seated myself by the fire, and lulled by warmth and the patter of the rain on the window, I fell asleep. I may have dreamt, for during my sleep I had a vague semi-consciousness as of hands being softly pressed on my pockets &#x2014; no doubt induced by the story of the robbery. When I came fully to my senses, I found Hemlock Jones sitting on the other side of the hearth, his deeply concentrated gaze fixed on the fire.<br><br>'I found you so comfortably asleep that I could not bear to awaken you,' he said, with a smile.<br><br>I rubbed my eyes. 'And what news?' I asked. 'How have you succeeded?'<br><br>'Better than I expected,' he said, 'and I think,' he added, tapping his note-book, 'I owe much to you.'<br><br>Deeply gratified, I awaited more. But in vain. I ought to have remembered that in his moods Hemlock Jones was reticence itself. I told him simply of the strange intrusion, but he only laughed.<br><br>Later, when I arose to go, he looked at me playfully.'If you were a married man,' he said, 'I would advise you not to go home until you had brushed your sleeve. There are a few short brown sealskin hairs on the inner side of your forearm, just where they would have adhered if your arm had encircled a sealskin coat with some pressure!'<br><br>'For once you are at fault,' I said triumphantly; 'the hair is my own, as you will perceive; I have just had it cut at the hairdresser's, and no doubt this arm projected beyond the apron.'<br><br>He frowned slightly, yet, nevertheless, on my turning to go he embraced me warmly &#x2014; a rare exhibition in that man of ice. He even helped me on with my overcoat and pulled out and smoothed down the flaps of my pockets. He was particular, too, in fitting my arm in my overcoat sleeve, shaking the sleeve down from the armhole to the cuff with his deft fingers. 'Come again soon!' he said, clapping me on the back.<br><br>'At any and all times,' I said enthusiastically; 'I only ask ten minutes twice a day to eat a crust at my office, and four hours' sleep at night, and the rest of my time is devoted to you always, as you know.'<br><br>'It is indeed,' he said, with his impenetrable smile.<br><br>Nevertheless, I did not find him at home when I next called. One afternoon, when nearing my own home, I met him in one of his favorite disguises, &#x2013; a long blue swallowtailed coat, striped cotton trousers, large turn-over collar, blacked face, and white hat, carrying a tambourine. Of course to others the disguise was perfect, although it was known to myself, and I passed him &#x2013; according to an old understanding between us &#x2013; without the slightest recognition, trusting to a later explanation. At another time, as I was making a professional visit to the wife of a publican at the East End, I saw him, in the disguise of a brokendown artisan, looking into the window of an adjacent pawnshop. I was delighted to see that he was evidently following my suggestions, and in my joy I ventured to tip him a wink; it was abstractedly returned.<br><br>Two days later I received a note appointing a meeting at his lodgings that night. That meeting, alas! was the one memorable occurrence of my life, and the last meeting I ever had with Hemlock Jones! I will try to set it down calmly, though my pulses still throb with the recollection of it.<br><br>I found him standing before the fire, with that look upon his face which I had seen only once or twice in our acquaintance &#x2014; a look which I may call an absolute concatenation of inductive and deductive ratiocination &#x2014; from which all that was human, tender, or sympathetic was absolutely discharged. He was simply an icy algebraic symbol! Indeed, his whole being was concentrated to that extent that his clothes fitted loosely, and his head was absolutely so much reduced in size by his mental compression that his hat tipped back from his forehead and literally hung on his massive ears.<br><br>After I had entered he locked the doors, fastened the windows, and even placed a chair before the chimney. As I watched these significant precautions with absorbing interest, he suddenly drew a revolver and, presenting it to my temple, said in low, icy tones:<br><br>'Hand over that cigar case!'<br><br>Even in my bewilderment my reply was truthful, spontaneous, and involuntary.<br><br>'I haven't got it,' I said.<br><br>He smiled bitterly, and threw down his revolver. 'I expected that reply! Then let me now confront you with something more awful, more deadly, more relentless and convincing than that mere lethal weapon, &#x2014; the damning inductive and deductive proofs of your guilt!' He drew from his pocket a roll of paper and a note-book.<br><br>'But surely,' I gasped, 'you are joking! You could not for a moment believe &#x2014; '<br><br>'Silence! Sit down!' I obeyed.<br><br>'You have condemned yourself,' he went on pitilessly.'Condemned yourself on my processes, &#x2013; processes familiar to you, applauded by you, accepted by you for years! We will go back to the time when you first saw the cigar case. Your expressions,' he said in cold, deliberate tones, consulting his paper, were, ''How beautiful! I wish it were mine.''This was your first step in crime &#x2013; and my first indication.<br><br>From ''I wish it were mine'' to ''I will have it mine,'' and the mere detail, ''How can I make it mine?'' the advance was obvious. Silence! But as in my methods it was necessary that there should be an overwhelming inducement to the crime, that unholy admiration of yours for the mere trinket itself was not enough. You are a smoker of cigars.'<br><br>'But,' I burst out passionately, 'I told you I had given up smoking cigars.'<br><br>'Fool!' he said coldly, 'that is the second time you have committed yourself. Of course you told me! What more natural than for you to blazon forth that prepared and unsolicited statement to prevent accusation. Yet, as I said before, even that wretched attempt to cover up your tracks was not enough. I still had to find that overwhelming, impelling motive necessary to affect a man like you. That motive I found in the strongest of all impulses &#x2013; Love, I suppose you would call it,' he added bitterly, 'that night you called! You had brought the most conclusive proofs of it on your sleeve.'<br><br>'But &#x2014;' I almost screamed.<br><br>'Silence!' he thundered. 'I know what you would say. You would say that even if you had embraced some Young Person in a sealskin coat, what had that to do with the robbery? Let me tell you, then, that that sealskin coat represented the quality and character of your fatal entanglement!

Carse draws upon personal experiences to illustrate his insights, beginning with his observations of the proprietor of the Victory luncheonette in the East Village. A vet who lost a leg in combat, Ernie serves his customers with fluid energy and grace, working and cajoling his way through life with a minimum of resistance or resentment. As Carse recalls his own Wisconsin youth, including an unforgettable description of sailing Lake Michigan by starlight, he ponders the speechlessness of animals and the verbosity of humans, the roles of teacher and student, and the fact that there is no end to knowing. As he remembers the deadhis wife of 37 years and his brotherCarse muses on how easily we confuse religious practice with God, knowledge with understanding, and our visible, public selves with inner truth. <i>Donna Seaman</i>This thought-provoking book turns ordinary experiences on their heads, almost forcing readers to find the mystical in their own subjective engagement of daily events. Carse ( Finite and Infinite Games ), who is director of Religious Studies and professor of the history of literature at NYU, interprets his own life with the help of the Sufi poets, Aristotle, Descartes and Freud. Drawing parables from daily experience (a golf match, a Halloween party, a mouse eating a grain), Carse gently prods us to see beyond the obvious in the world and in our lives. In so doing, he brings the profound within the grasp of everyone. The engaging and insightful stories reconsidered here also explain why Carse has gained an almost cult-like following on his own campus as well as beyond it. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Accident: A Day&#39;s News: A Novel (Phoenix Fiction)</h2><p><p>An East German writer, awaiting a call from the hospital where her brother is undergoing brain surgery, instead receives news of a massive nuclear accident at Chernobyl, one thousand miles away.

This will free you to become a disciple&#x2013;in the modern sense&#x2013;to your own higher calling and service to the world.<br><br>Drawing on the wisdom of ancient scriptures and contemporary thinkers from many world traditions, tapping into her own and other disciples&#x2019; real-life stories and insights, Karpinski shares the Twelve Lessons of Spiritual Craftsmanship that are essential to the disciple&#x2019;s path.<br><br>These easy-to-follow lessons are divided into three parts: <i>Knowing the Way</i> explores the ways we recognize and understand our mission through Knowledge, Revelation, Body Wisdom, and Discernment; <i>Becoming the Way</i> illuminates the fundamental building principles of strong discipleship: Love, Will, Faith, and Power; and <i>Fulfilling the Way</i> reveals the practical process through which we bring our journey to fruition by Creating, Transforming, Enduring, and Serving. Integration, balance, and wisdom are the benefits of the twelve lessons, the treasured syntheses of yin and yang, light and shadow, heaven and earth. Full of exciting, effective spiritual exercises, <i>Barefoot on Holy Ground</i> leads readers purposefully along the path to Conscious Evolution so that they can embrace their higher calling.</p><p>There's a new breed of spiritual seeker emerging in the world, says author and teacher Gloria Karpinski in <i>Barefoot on Holy Ground</i>. "I call them disciples--awake, aware, committed, and global in their worldview," she writes. Nonetheless, no matter how spiritually sophisticated we fancy ourselves, we are still works in progress, which is why Karpinski compiled this contemporary guide to spiritual growth. Drawing from numerous traditions, she offers a vast holy ground for the new breed of disciples to walk upon. The book's organization can seem disjointed, as when it jumps from "Opening the Heart Chakra" to "Breaking the Should Syndrome" in the same chapter. Yet <i>Holy Ground</i> is certainly comprehensive, with chapters covering spiritual topics such as love, will, faith, and creativity. In every chapter, Karpinski offers minilectures and numerous exercises. When she delves into "shadow work," Karpinski provides a solid Jungian discussion about facing one's dark side, then slips into her seminar voice, listing 21 signs for "Recognizing the Shadow," including "You need to ridicule anything" and "You have a well-defined list of pet peeves." Fortunately, these shifts in narrative are only mildly distracting, and and the blend of theory and application ultimately serves the reader well. <i>--Gail Hudson</i><b>Gloria D.

The greater Latino community did not often accept sexual minorities, and the mainstream LGBT movement expected everyone, regardless of their ethnic and racial background, to adhere to a specific set of priorities so as to accommodate a &#x201c;unified&#x201d; agenda. To disrupt the cycle of sexism, racism, and homophobia that they experienced, LGBT Latinas/os organized themselves on local, state, and national levels, forming communities in which they could fight for equal rights while simultaneously staying true to both their ethnic and sexual identities. Yet histories of LGBT activism in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s often reduce the role that Latinas/os played, resulting in misinformation, or ignore their work entirely, erasing them from history.</p><p><i>Queer Brown Voices</i> is the first book published to counter this trend, documenting the efforts of some of these LGBT Latina/o activists. Comprising essays and oral history interviews that present the experiences of fourteen activists across the United States and in Puerto Rico, the book offers a new perspective on the history of LGBT mobilization and activism. The activists discuss subjects that shed light not only on the organizations they helped to create and operate, but also on their broad-ranging experiences of being racialized and discriminated against, fighting for access to health care during the HIV/AIDS epidemic, and struggling for awareness.</p></p><p>Uriel Quesada is associate dean of the College of Humanities and Natural Sciences, an associate professor of Spanish, and director of the Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies at Loyola University New Orleans.<br>Letitia Gomez has been a Latina lesbian activist for over thirty years.

W. Winnicott&#39;s best writing about children. The remarkable, enduring essays from Babies and Their Mothers and Talking to Parents are here combined with several hard-to-find gems of insight into the world of the child. Each piece was written for a wide audience of parents, childcare professionals, and teachers. In his empathic and witty way, Winnicott ranges over such timeless topics as the mother/infant relationship, trust, instilling a sense of security, negativism, jealousy and moral development. Now, in one volume, anyone who cares about children can enjoy the wisdom of a man many consider to be the most important psychoanalyst since Freud.A Merloyd Lawrence Book</p><p><b>D. W. Winnicott</b> (1896-1974), pediatrician and psychoanalyst, influenced several generations in the fields of child psychiatry, social work, and child development as well as psychoanalysis. He is known especially for his bold and brilliant imagination, and his unique, even poetic style.Before Benjamin Spock and T. Berry Brazelton made a name for themselves, Winnicott (l896-1971) was considered the best pediatrician/psychoanalyst writing about children. The Briton made over 50 broadcasts for the BBC between 1939 and 1962 and wrote more than 20 works. Collected here for the first time in one volume are 26 of his best-known essays, all of which were previously published in one form or another. Spock, Brazelton, and Stanley Greenspan wrote introductions for each of the three sections ("Babies and Their Mothers," "Talking to Parents," and "The Child in the Family"). Winnicott is not an advice-dispenser; rather, he offers insights and observations into babies' emotions and intellect. He places high value on the role of a mother in nurturing her child's psychological development. While his style is conversational and gentle, he quietly probes the ideas of trust, security, jealousy, and early relationships. The result is worthy reading for mothers, students of child development, and others seeking something deeper than a quick-fix handbook.<br><i>Linda Beck, Indian Valley P.L., Telford, PA</i><br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Mary Queen of Scotland and The Isles: A Novel</h2><p><p><b>Margaret George's exhaustively researched novel skillfully weaves both historical fact and plausible fiction in bringing the story of Mary Queen of Scots to life. </b></p><p>She was a child crowned a queen....<br>A sinner hailed as a saint....<br>A lover denounced as a whore...<br>A woman murdered for her dreams...</p><p>Margaret George's <i>Mary Queen of Scotland and the Isles</i> brings to life the fascinating story of Mary, who became the Queen of Scots when she was only six days old. Raised in the glittering French court, returning to Scotland to rule as a Catholic monarch over a newly Protestant country, and executed like a criminal in Queen Elizabeth's England, Queen Mary lived a life like no other, and Margaret George weaves the facts into a stunning work of historical fiction.</p><p>"With a seamless use of original letters, diaries, and poems: a popular, readable, inordinately moving tribute to a remarkable queen." -- <i>Kirkus Reviews</i></p></p><p><b>Margaret George</b> is the author of <i>The Autobiography of Henry VIII, The Memoirs of Cleopatra</i>, and <i>Elizabeth I,</i> among other novels. Margaret first got the idea to write historical fiction when, after reading numerous books that viewed Henry VIII through the eyes of his enemies and victims, she found herself wondering if there might be another side to the story. She became determined to let Henry speak for himself, and it took fifteen years, about three hundred books of background reading, three visits to England to see every extant building associated with Henry, and five handwritten drafts for her to answer the question: What was Henry really like? Margaret was born in Nashville, Tennessee, and has traveled extensively. She and her husband live in Madison, Wisconsin.By the author of The Autobiography of Henry VIII (1986), another vast involvement with a legendary royal. The Scots queen (1542-1587), crowned at nine months, shipped out for a French marriage at seven, became queen of France at 16 for a year and a half, then returned to Scotland after the death of the French king- -to four years of early triumph and then tragedy, two marriages, warfare, betrayal, power struggles, dazzling escapes, and, at the last, a flight to England--and doom. George has created a lively, gallant Mary of intelligence, charm, and terrible judgment--in outline true enough, and fictionally persuasive. Unlike cousin Elizabeth I of England, Mary enjoyed a richly cosseted and loving childhood and youth; arriving back in Scotland then--a Scotland bristling with religious ferment, plots, and a history of regencies--is a shock, at first bewildering, then exhilarating. But there are the trumpet blasts of Reformed Kirk theologian John Knox against a female ruler (and a Catholic to boot) and the obvious intent of the Queen's inner circle of lords to rule for her. There's also Mary's stubborn, disastrous choice of a husband--the ``blue and gold lad,'' Lord Darnley, soon slipped into drink and debauchery and even murder. Mary's second husband after Darnley's murder (George absolves Mary of a conscious plot) is the Earl of Bothwell, here given an unusually heroic cast. Throughout, there are astonishing escapes, nick-of-time rescues by Bothwell, fleeting interludes of lovers' joys--as well as betrayal, sieges, and abuse, sadly from the people who once cheered her (``the people...with all their pitchforks, fervous and bad breath...mutable...but stronger than granite''). At the last- -another truly terrible decision--Mary flees to Elizabeth I for sanctuary, and is imprisoned for 20 years while the dismayed English queen makes up her mind. With a seamless use of original letters, diaries, and poems: a popular, readable, inordinately moving tribute to a remarkable queen. -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP.

At once brilliant and infuriating, self-important and courageous, Hastings&#x2019;s Churchill comes brashly to life as never before.&nbsp;<br><br>Beginning in 1940, when popular demand elevated Churchill to the role of prime minister, and concluding with the end of the war, Hastings shows us Churchill at his most intrepid and essential, when, by sheer force of will, he kept Britain from collapsing in the face of what looked like certain defeat. Later, we see his significance ebb as the United States enters the war and the Soviets turn the tide on the Eastern Front. But Churchill, Hastings reminds us, knew as well as anyone that the war would be dominated by others, and he managed his relationships with the other Allied leaders strategically, so as to maintain Britain&#x2019;s influence and limit Stalin&#x2019;s gains.&nbsp;<br><br>At the same time, Churchill faced political peril at home, a situation for which he himself was largely to blame. Hastings shows how Churchill nearly squandered the miraculous escape of the British troops at Dunkirk and failed to address fundamental flaws in the British Army. His tactical inaptitude and departmental meddling won him few friends in the military, and by 1942, many were calling for him to cede operational control. Nevertheless, Churchill managed to exude a public confidence that brought the nation through the bitter war.&nbsp;<br><br>Hastings rejects the traditional Churchill hagiography while still managing to capture what he calls Churchill&#x2019;s &#x201c;appetite for the fray.&#x201d; Certain to be a classic,&nbsp;<i>Winston&#x2019;s War</i>&nbsp;is a riveting profile of one of the greatest leaders of the twentieth century.</p></p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, May 2010</strong> <i>Winston's War</i> is a brilliant tribute to the leadership of Winston Churchill during the bleakest hours of World War II. Employing an oratory genius that awed proponents and critics alike, the British Prime Minister fortified national pride and resolve by remaining fiercely defiant in the face of a powerful Axis war machine. Yet historian Max Hastings provides more than just a look at the inner workings of one man, as he extends beyond the words of the dynamic leader to portray an honest account of the emotions that defined Great Britain during the 1940's. Contrary to what his gilded legacy may lead future generations to believe, Churchill did not cement his place in history by winning unanimous public support. Rather, he achieved his iconic status by empowering "millions to look beyond the havoc of the battlefield...and perceive a higher purpose in their struggles and sacrifices." <i>--Dave Callanan</i> <p></p> <strong>Lynne Olson Reviews <em>Winston's War</em></strong><br><br> <b>Lynne Olson, a former Moscow correspondent for the <i>Associated Press</i> and White House correspondent for the <i>Baltimore Sun</i>, is the author of <em>Citizens of London</em>, <em>Troublesome Young Men</em>, <em>Freedom&#x2019;s Daughters</em> and co-author, with her husband, Stanley Cloud, of <em>A Question of Honor</em> and <em>The Murrow Boys</em>. She lives in Washington, D.C.</b> <p> </p> <p>British historian Max Hastings has entered a very crowded field with <i>Winston&#x2019;s War</i>, his new book about Winston Churchill&#x2019;s direction of the British effort in World War II. Hastings, the author of the acclaimed military histories <em>Armageddon</em> and <em>Retribution</em>, readily acknowledges the problem, noting that no human being has been written about more than Churchill. Yet he accomplishes what he has set out to do--provide an insightful, compelling portrait of the political outcast who came to power at the gravest moment in his country&#x2019;s history and, over the course of a desperate summer, rallied the British to stand alone against Hitler.</p> <p>Hastings is clear-eyed about Churchill&#x2019;s not inconsiderable shortcomings as a warlord, including a penchant for rash, ill-thought-out raids and other military operations "more appropriate to a Victorian cavalry subaltern than to the director of a vast industrial war effort." Yet, as he points out, that same capacity for boldness enabled Churchill--one of the few British prime ministers ever to have fought in a war himself--to spur into action not only his demoralized countrymen but also Britain&#x2019;s sclerotic military establishment, whose fortress mentality was the bane of his wartime existence. </p> <p>Equally important was Churchill&#x2019;s assiduous courtship of the American people and their president, Franklin D. Roosevelt. While the prime minister&#x2019;s relationship with Roosevelt was never as close as Churchill later claimed, he exerted a sizable influence on FDR&#x2019;s decisionmaking early in the war, including the critical decision to launch a 1942 invasion of North Africa, rather than the premature assault on France that the U.S. military brass had been urging--an attack that almost certainly would have ended in disaster. </p> <p>In the last two years of the conflict, however, the prime minister&#x2019;s influence in Washington waned dramatically. To his considerable pain and alarm, Roosevelt paid far more heed to the wishes and demands of Stalin and the Soviets than to Churchill and the British, who now were consigned to junior partnership in the Grand Alliance. Yet Hastings makes a convincing case that Churchill&#x2019;s still-commanding stature in the United States helped maintain Britain&#x2019;s status as a key, if diminished, player during the war&#x2019;s endgame--a time when this exhausted country could easily have been pushed into the shadows as "a backwater, supply center and aircraft carrier for American-led armies in Europe."</p> <p>Above all, though, Churchill will be remembered for his clarion calls of defiance and hope in the summer of 1940, almost singlehandedly changing the mood of his nation and rousing the British to fight on in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds. "Gradually we came under the spell of that wonderful voice and inspiration," one London woman later wrote. "His stature grew larger and larger, until it filled our sky."</p> (Photo � Stanley Cloud)<br> <br> <p><strong>Max Hastings on <em>Winston's War</em></strong></p> <p></p> <p>Why another Churchill book? We have been told more about him than any other human being. Most of my own research for this book has been done not in the Churchill papers, gutted by historians, but among military and civilian diaries, newspaper files, British, American and Russian records. What I have tried to do is to portray the story of Churchill at war in the context of his relationships with the British and American peoples, the armed forces, the Russians. All these were more complex than is sometimes acknowledged.</p> <p>It is easy to identify his strategic errors and misplaced enthusiasms. Yet the outcome justified all. The defining fact of Churchill&#x2019;s leadership was Britain&#x2019;s emergence from the war among the victors. No warlord, no commander, in history has failed to make mistakes. It is as easy to catalogue the errors of Alexander the Great, Caesar, Napoleon as those of Churchill. He towers over the war, standing higher than any other single human being at the head of the forces of light. Without him, Britain&#x2019;s part would have seemed pretty small by VE-Day. Russia and the United States had played the dominant parts. No honourable course of action existed which could have averted his nation&#x2019;s bankruptcy and exhaustion in 1945, its eclipse from world power.</p> <p>Churchill did not command the confidence of all the British people all of the time. But his rhetoric empowered millions to look beyond the havoc of the battlefield, the squalor of their circumstances amid privation and bombardment, and to perceive a higher purpose in their struggles and sacrifices. This was, of course, of greater importance in 1940-41 than later, when the allies could commit superior masses of men and material to securing victory. But Churchill&#x2019;s words remain a lasting force in causing the struggle against Hitler to be perceived by posterity as &#x2018;the good war&#x2019;. </p> <p>He cherished aspirations which often proved greater than his nation was capable of fulfilling, which is one of my central themes. But it is inconsistent to applaud his defiance of reason in insisting that Britain must fight on in June 1940, and denounce the extravagance of his later demands upon its people and armed forces. Service chiefs often deplored his misjudgements and intemperance. Yet his instinct for war was much more highly developed than their own.</p> <p>History must take Churchill as a whole, as his wartime countrymen were obliged to do, rather than employ a spoke shave to strip away the blemishes created by his lunges into excess and folly, which were real enough. If the governance of nations in peace is best conducted by reasonable men, in war there is a powerful argument for leadership by those sometimes willing to adopt courses beyond the boundaries of reason, as Churchill did in 1940-41. His foremost quality was strength of will. This was so fundamental to his triumph in the early war years, that it seems absurd to suggest that he should have become more biddable, merely because in 1943-45 his stubbornness was sometimes deployed in support of misjudged purposes. </p> <p>As he left Chequers for the last time in July 1945, he wrote in its visitor&#x2019;s book: &#x2018;FINIS.&#x2019; Three weeks later, on 15 August, Japan&#x2019;s surrender brought an end to the Second World War. Churchill was among the greatest actors upon the stage of affairs the world has ever known. Familiarity with his speeches, conversation and the fabulous anecdotage about his wartime doings, does nothing to diminish our capacity to be moved to awe, tears, laughter by the sustained magnificence of his performance. He has become today a shared British and American legend. If his leadership was imperfect, no other British ruler in history has matched his achievement nor, please God, is ever likely to find himself in circumstances to surpass it.</p><p>Max Hastings is the author of more than twenty books, including&nbsp;<i>Catastrophe 1914: Europe Goes to War,</i>&nbsp;<i>Inferno: The World at War, 1939&#x2013;1945,&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>Winston's War: Churchill 1940-1945.</i>&nbsp;He spent his early career as a foreign correspondent for BBC TV and various newspapers, then as editor of Britain&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>Evening Standard</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Daily Telegraph</i>.

Both teams were undefeated; both featured devastating and innovative offenses; both boasted stingy defenses; and both were coached by superior tacticians and stirring motivators, Texas's Darrell Royal and Arkansas's Frank Broyles. Moreover, President Richard Nixon was on hand to present his own national championship plaque to the winners. Even if it had been just a game, it would have been memorable today. But it was much more, because nothing was so simple in December 1969. In Horns, Hogs, &amp; Nixon Coming, Terry Frei deftly weaves the social, political, and athletic trends together for an unforgettable look at one of the landmark college sporting events of all time.</p><p>Terry Frei is a columnist for the Denver Post, and regularly contributes articles to ESPN.com and The Sporting News. He lives in Denver.<b>Prologue: Good Morning, Mr. President</b> <p>UCLA defensive coordinator Bobby Field loved his three-and-a-half-mile run through the canyons above the Westwood campus on early spring mornings, when he could hear the sprinklers and smell the damp grass. He tried to make it an escape from the Xs and Os of the game, but strategic revelations came in flashes -- such as when one arrived shortly after he crossed Sunset Boulevard and started up Stone Canyon Road.</p> <p><i>The new safety is going to be quick enough to send after the quarterback on second-and-long, especially against teams with tailbacks who don't check if they're needed to block for the quarterback before drifting into the flat and leaving a lane wider than -- </i></p> <p><i>What's this?</i></p> <p>On this morning, near the stately, sprawling, and isolated Hotel Bel-Air, where the famous stay to be unseen and where the smell is either of the hotel's plush Gardens or of old money, three men are walking toward Field. It is 6:15 a.m., a time in the Bel-Air Estates for expensive sweatsuits or shorts or golf shirts or cashmere sweaters, or perhaps for a chauffeur's uniform, if the driver is stretching his legs as he waits for his wealthy passenger. But these three men are in dark suits, white shirts, and ties, and they are strolling downhill toward the jogging and sweating football coach who is trying to avoid developing the sort of paunch that fills those coaching shirts and can be so embarrassing on television.</p> <p>Suddenly, Field realizes the slightly hunched figure between two guards is Richard Milhous Nixon.</p> <p>It is March 30, 1985, nearly eleven years since the resignation, and a week before the opening of the Bruins' spring practices. Field doesn't know this, but the night before, the ex-president dined with former <i>Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In</i> producer Paul Keyes at Chasen's, and Nixon's "Sock-It-to-Me" cameo on the classic television show undoubtedly came up. Later, Nixon would check out of the hotel to leave for Rancho Mirage and the "Sunnylands" estate of Walter Annenberg, the founder of <i>TV Guide</i> and the ambassador to Great Britain during the Nixon administration. Now, Nixon is taking a morning walk with two guards, who check out Field. They conclude he doesn't have a knife hidden in the elastic band of his jogging shorts.</p> <p>So what's the protocol here, Bobby Field? Whistle "Hail to the Chief" as you pass? Veer off path, as if there is a presidential halo that remains after the exit from office? Hold both hands aloft, signaling "V" for victory over Humphrey and McGovern?</p> <p>Like a quarterback under siege, Field has only a few seconds to make a choice, and he nods in midstride, and puffs out a greeting.</p> <p>"Good morning!"</p> <p>Nixon nods back. It is almost imperceptible, but it is there, the slight acknowledgment. Now Field is past the former president, heading further into the foothills.</p> <p><i>Good morning?</i></p> <p>Bobby Field comes across Richard Nixon for the second time in his life, and that's all he can say? He choked in the clutch, he lectures himself on the move. He runs for another ten minutes on his uphill portion, passing immaculate homes, then takes one more stride to the north and reverses direction, as if he had stepped on the line at the end of the field during "gasser" drills and must start back the other way. It's time to head back to the UCLA football offices and prepare for the workday -- film, practice plans, staff meetings, all the details involved in getting ready for the Bruins' upcoming season.</p> <p>As Field runs back down Stone Canyon Road, he again approaches the Hotel Bel-Air, on his right. Nixon and his two protectors are standing near the canopied stone footbridge that leads over a pond to the hotel. Field tells himself to be braver this time. He slows and veers toward the former president. The guards' heads turn: It's the jogger again. Field downgrades to a walk, catches Nixon's eyes, and approaches. He reaches out his hand and speaks.</p> <p>Sir, he says, my name is Bobby Field, and I just wanted to say hello.</p> <p>Why, thank you, the ex-president responds. He is being courteous, not warm. Nixon's escorts are scanning Field again, making sure.</p> <p>Field says he is a football coach on Terry Donahue's staff at UCLA, down in Westwood -- the defensive coordinator, in fact. Now Nixon is perking up. "As a matter of fact," Field says, "in 1969, I was playing for the University of Arkansas and you, sir, came to one of our games, the one in Fayetteville against the University of Texas."</p> <p>In the respectful formality of a conversation with the one-time most powerful man in the world, it just seems right to say "University of Arkansas" and "University of Texas," and not just blurt it out -- "the Texas-Arkansas game."</p> <p>Field also doesn't mention that he has been teased for years because an instant after he fell on a Texas fumble on the second play of the game, the ABC shot switched to a late-arriving president making his way into the stadium -- and the distracted announcer later told the millions of viewers <i>somebody else</i> came up with the ball! Field doesn't mention that to Nixon because that would be rude, and besides, now the former president is excited. Nixon is so excited, in fact, that the other two men in dark suits are astounded and transfixed as the one-time Whittier College benchwarmer gives the former Razorback, who <i>played</i> in the game, a virtual play-by-play account and strategic analysis of that afternoon in Razorback Stadium.</p> <p>With an amazed Field standing there sweating in the morning sun and hazy smog, the former president goes on and on. "And, oh," he says, "it was such a terrific game, what a shame it was that someone had to lose." As Nixon continues, Field tells himself it's almost as if the former president had watched the game film the night before.</p> <p>Bobby Field, who as a stunned Arkansas defensive back stood among sniffling teammates in a tiny dressing room at the end of Razorback Stadium when President Richard Nixon told them they should be proud, nods and tells the former president that it indeed was a privilege to be able to say he had been on that field on December 6, 1969.</p> <p>***</p> <p>It was a game Richard Nixon couldn't forget, and he wasn't alone.</p> <p>Yet there was more to it than four quarters of football, or what Texas coach Darrell Royal dubbed "The Big Shootout." The final regular-season game in the centennial year of college football, it also came in the final days when the faces under the helmets all could be white and the simple question "Why?" could be rank insubordination. Maybe it was why there weren't blacks in the programs sooner, or why workouts sometimes seemed designed to run off the lesser players, or why some of the coaches (and even the trainer!) acted as if a visit to the training room for treatment was a sign of weakness, not sensibility. <i>"No, son, you shoot it up and you play and you will thank us years later."</i> (And many of them did! Again and again in later years, the Hogs and Horns would discuss the football mentality of their playing era, shake their heads, and qualify it with something like: <i>"But that's just how it was then."</i> Rather than applying twenty-first-century standards retroactively and pervasively, anyone with a sense for the era understood exactly what they meant.)</p> <p><i>That's just how it was then.</i></p> <p>While college football was struggling with its evolution -- an evolution progressing at differing paces around the country -- the game often served to highlight aspects of national polarization in the late sixties. Many wanted sports to be an escape from turmoil, but by the end of the decade, sports often contributed to the general unrest. The most notorious instance was when sprinters Tommie Smith and John Carlos raised gloved fists during the medal ceremony at the 1968 Olympics, arguing that in fact the nation still wasn't for all its citizens the land of the free, even fourteen years after <i>Brown v. Board of Education</i> and four years after the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and following epic struggles in the civil rights movement. In 1969, campuses were boiling caldrons, primarily because of anti-Vietnam War sentiment, often angrily expressed, but it was linked also to a general sense of disillusionment and cynicism. John Kennedy, Martin Luther King, and Robert Kennedy were dead and still mourned. In Fayetteville that day, and even that week, the football game provided a focal point for that polarization, although the evidence of its significance was mostly ignored at the time -- as if the cheers and martial music drowned out everything else happening both in the nation and on a campus struggling with racial antipathy and divisiveness.</p> <p>One political protest came off that afternoon in Fayetteville. Another, which would have been far more embarrassing to University of Arkansas officials and disruptive to the national television broadcast, was always one trumpet -- or tuba or trombone -- note away from beginning. That demonstration, even if angry and prolonged, would have been preferable to the racially charged armed conflict that seemed on the verge of breaking out the night before the game in Fayetteville.</p> <p>One of Nixon's White House successors was in the Razorback Stadium seats that day. Another was in England, wondering how quickly his angst-filled letter could get from Oxford to Fayetteville.

Bush travels, the president's plane has captured the public's awe and imagination, and is recognized around the world as a symbol of American power. In this unique book, Kenneth Walsh looks at the decisions that our last 12 presidents made on the plane; the personality traits and peccadilloes they revealed when their guard was down; and the way they each established a distinctive mood aboard that was a reflection of their times, as well as their individual personalities.<br><br>Based on interviews with four living presidents, scores of past and present White House officials, and staff and crew members of Air Force One, Walsh's book reveals countless fascinating stories of life aboard the "flying White House." It also features descriptions of the food, the decor, the bedrooms, the medical clinic, and much more--as well as remarkable photos of the planes (inside and out) and the presidents.</p><p><strong>Kenneth T. Walsh</strong> has covered the White House since 1986 and has won the two most prestigious honors for reporting on the presidency. He is also the former president of the White House Correspondents' Association. The author of two books, <em>Ronald Reagan</em> and <em>Feeding the Beast</em>, he has served as adjunct professor of communication at American University in Washington, D.C., and is often a guest on MSNBC, Fox News, and other television and radio programs. He lives in Bethesda, Maryland.This peek inside the "flying Oval Office" comes courtesy of U.S. News and World Report's award-winning White House correspondent, who has logged more than 200 trips aboard Air Force One. To document the history and evolution of the "flying White House," Walsh (Feeding the Beast: The White House Versus the Press) interviewed more than 120 people, including the plane's crews and staff, plus past presidents and White House officials. Americans once thought presidents should "never stray from the United States," but FDR "changed the whole dynamic," becoming the first airborne chief executive when he flew to a secret 1943 meeting with Churchill in Casablanca. Truman, who used "the plane itself as a power tool," was the first to fly routinely, and Eisenhower was the first to travel by jet. The code name Air Force One was introduced in Ike's era after air traffic controllers confused Eastern 610 with the president's Air Force 610. JFK made the code name public, and his sleek new 707 "seemed to embody modernity itself" after Jackie Kennedy and industrial designer Raymond Loewy devised the now-familiar blue-and-white exterior. Focusing on the mystique and prestige of Air Force One and its ascendancy as a symbol of world power, Walsh describes key decisions made in the air, leaving a contrail of anecdotes about presidential behavior aloft, and concludes by detailing the dramatic events aboard the presidential jet on September 11 when the controversial decision was made not to return to Washington. 8 pages of color, 8 pages of b&amp;w photos not seen by PW.<br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>French for Children, Primer A (Student Edition) (English and French Edition)</h2><p>This classical, beautiful, and widely spoken language will be a treasure for children to learn.

She lives in New York City and Old Lyme, Connecticut.<i>Chapter One<br></i><br>June, 2003<br>Her mother's best friend lived in a blue house, and that was all Nell Kilvert knew. So, from the minute she and her father had arrived at the beach for their summer vacation, Nell had kept her eyes peeled for a blue house. When she asked her father where it might be, he said that after so many years away, his only strong memory of Hubbard's Point was of falling in love with her mother on the boardwalk.<br><br>Beach girls now, beach girls tomorrow, beach girls till the end of time . . . Nell still remembered her mother's stories about Hubbard's Point, where she'd spent her childhood summers. She said that she and Aunt Madeleine and her best friend--what was her name?--were happiest with their feet in salt water. Her mother had said that no matter where they were, no matter where life took them, they would always be united by blue summer skies, high winds and sudden gales, and hot beach sand under their bare feet.<br><br>Hot beach sand . . . <br><br>Nell felt it now, scalding the soles of her tender feet. "Ouch, ouch," she said out loud.<br><br>A girl about nine--her age--looked up from her beach towel. "Stand here," she said, moving over so Nell could get some relief from the hot sand.<br><br>"Thanks," Nell said, standing on the very edge of the girl's towel.<br><br>"Do you live here?" the girl asked.<br><br>"We're renting a cottage," Nell said. "My father and I."<br><br>"That's good," the girl said. "What's your name?"<br><br>"Nell Kilvert. What's yours?"<br><br>"Peggy McCabe. I live here. Year-round."<br><br>"Oh," Nell said. She felt funny standing on the corner of the strange red-haired girl's towel, and thought how cool and fun it would be to live at the beach all year. Then, realizing that she had a Hubbard's Point expert on her hands, her eyes widened. "Do you know any blue houses?"<br><br>Peggy looked puzzled. "Well--that one," she said, pointing.<br><br>Nell looked over. Tall grass grew at the end of the beach, holding the sand in place so that no storm could ever wash it away. A big blue house nestled on the low dune--Nell had thought it had to be a beach club, but her father had told her it belonged to some lucky family. He had told her that it was built on pilings, to keep it above the highest tides, and that when they were young, he and her mother had gone underneath to kiss. Did it belong to Mom's best friend? Nell had asked, tingling. No, we didn't know the owners, her father had replied.<br><br>"A different blue house," Nell said to Peggy.<br><br>"Oh," Peggy said, getting a funny look on her face. "The witch's house."<br><br>"The witch?"<br><br>Peggy nodded, scooting over even farther on her striped towel, inviting Nell to sit down. She pointed across the crescent of white sand and sparkling bay to a house on the Point, hidden in lacy blue shadows of oak and fir trees. Nell peered, shielding her eyes from the sun with visor-hands. "That house looks white to me," she said.<br><br>"It is now," Peggy said. "But it used to be blue. When I was really little. I remember, because my sister Annie had a song about it:<br>Heart of stone, house of blue,<br><br>If you come in my yard<br><br>I'll make you a witch, too. . . ."<br>Nell stared up at the house. She was skeptical: her mother's best friend couldn't be a witch. On the other hand, Nell had ruled out just about every other cottage at Hubbard's Point. She had ridden her bike up and down all the roads with her father. And she'd gone back to the only two blue cottages she'd found and asked the people if they remembered her mother, Emma Kilvert. Both times, the answer was no.<br><br>"Why do you call her a witch?" Nell asked.<br><br>"Because no one ever sees her," Peggy said. "She lives in New York all winter, and when she's here, she stays in her yard till after dark. She talks to owls. She writes children's books about all different birds. One got made into a movie. People who don't know how weird she is come from outside the beach to look for her--but she doesn't even answer her door! And every morning, before the sun comes up, she walks along the tide line to look for shorebirds and her lost diamond ring."<br><br>"Her lost diamond ring?" Nell asked.<br><br>"Yes. She's a divorcee. She's been married lots of times. No kids, even though she writes kids' books. She collected the engagement rings, and wears them on all her fingers. But she lost the biggest one while she was swimming in a storm, and she has to find it. It's worth thousands. She puts spells on the men who cross her! And on kids who trespass in her yard. They read her books, and she chases them away. You should see the sign she has by her stairs. . . ."<br><br>Nell frowned, hugging her knees, making herself small. She didn't like the sound of this woman. Maybe it was a mistake to want to meet her. . . . But then she thought of her father and his new girlfriend, Francesca, and she thought of her mother's soft blue eyes, with the gentle sun lines around the outside corners, and of the way she used to talk about her best friend, and Nell felt a hole in her stomach.<br><br>Beach girls now, beach girls tomorrow, beach girls till the end of time . . . <br><br>Just thinking of the old saying made the shiver worse, and the hole bigger, and made Nell miss her mother so much she thought the sorrow might crush her right there on the beach. She stared up at the house on the hill, holding her knees tighter.<br><br>Could her mother's best friend be a book-writing witch? Nothing seemed impossible anymore. In fact, compared to other things that had happened during Nell's lifetime, that didn't even seem so weird or terrible. She thanked Peggy for the information, and then she set off to find a way up the hill to the House That Used to Be Blue.<br>The Hubbard's Point tennis courts had come a long way from when Jack Kilvert was a kid. Back then, they were cracked blacktop, a second thought to the beach and marsh, sloping into the sandy parking lot, underwater during big storms. Now they were green composite, neatly lined, rolled, and maintained--and people had to sign up to use them.<br><br>"Thirty-love!" Francesca called from across the net.<br><br>Jack concentrated as she prepared to serve. Her hair was honey brown, held back by a wide white band that set off her tan. Willow thin, except for the hourglass factor, she had legs that went on forever, and, in spite of his attempting to focus on the game, Jack was aware that she had stopped some traffic. Two men, smok-ing cigars and carrying beach chairs and floats, had stopped on their way down Phelps Road to watch her serve. Or stare at her legs.<br><br>She served, he returned, she jumped the net into his arms.<br><br>"You won, you bum," she said, kissing him on the lips.<br><br>"Doesn't that mean I'm supposed to jump the net?" he said.<br><br>"Don't get technical about everything. Maybe I was just in a big hurry to hold your big sweaty body--did you ever think of that?"<br><br>Jack laughed as she kissed him again. She felt thin and hard in his arms. He had a memory that bypassed his mind entirely, existing solely in his heart: of holding Emma twenty-five years ago, right in this same spot. Francesca was the spitting image of his wife as a young woman. Jack did the age math, and his head hurt.<br><br>"Come on, let's jump in the ocean," Francesca said.<br><br>"I want to go home and check on Nell."<br><br>"She told me she was going to the beach," Francesca said. "In fact, she saw me pull up in front of the house, and she met me before I even got out of the car. I think she wanted to go through my trunk, to make sure I hadn't brought an overnight bag. Honestly, she's like the border patrol."<br><br>"No, she was just welcoming you."<br><br>Francesca snorted through her pretty, perfect nose. "You are so not right about that. My parents were divorced, and when my father brought women home, I gave them hell. This is my payback--and believe me, I deserve it. Don't worry, though. I don't scare easy, and I totally respect her need to stake out her territory. I'll win her over--you'll see."<br><br>Jack didn't say anything, not wanting to give her the wrong idea about where things were going.<br><br>"Look . . . if she's at the beach, that means your house is empty," Francesca said, squeezing his hand. "I already know you have to be proper on the chance she'll walk in on us, but can we at least hold hands on the couch?"<br><br>"While going over our British North Sea plans . . ." Jack said. They both laughed, Jack pulling back his hand as they set off, thinking, Real romantic, you jerk. He was forty-eight, overwhelmed, overworked, and totally confused about life's twists and turns. She was twenty-nine, dangerously beautiful.<br><br>For the last six months, Jack had been in the Boston office of an Atlanta engineering firm. Francesca worked in his department now, and they had been colleagues for several years before that. They played mixed doubles together with people from work. He admired her serve, the precision of her mind, the excellence of her engineering skills, her great sense of humor.<br><br>Did she notice that he was keeping distance between them, not wanting people to think he was part of a couple? And just who would care? Who would even remember him? Emma had spent about fifteen childhood summers here, before her family had moved to Chicago. Jack's family had rented here for three years in a row; Emma was four years younger--his sister's age. He had met her on the boardwalk one clear July night, and their fates were sealed. This year, needing a place to take Nell on vacation, he had chosen Hubbard's Point over the Vineyard, Nantucket, the Cape, islands in Maine . . . not so much because he wanted her to see the place where her parents had met, but because he'd been pulled here by forces he couldn't understand.<br><br>"If your daughter's not home," Francesca whispered, closing the gap as they walked, "I can't promise that I'll behave myself. . . ."<br><br>Jack felt the grin on his face, in the muscles around his mouth, but it didn't register anywhere else. He could show a smile, but he couldn't feel one. That had been the biggest curse of losing Emma. He was numb to the bone, as if winter had come to stay for the rest of his life. He was six foot three, had been an athlete since he could throw a ball, and he couldn't feel anything. Guys in his basketball league didn't know, his tennis partners had no clue, the women he dated wouldn't guess, his own sister, Madeleine, was in the dark.<br><br>Only Nell knew, and he hated that she did.<br>The road to the Point looped up from the beach, right past the tennis courts. Nell glanced over, just in time to see her father and Francesca kissing at the net, too busy to look up and witness her passing by. Seeing her father kiss Francesca was like a dagger in Nell's heart and made her in a greater rush to get to the House That Used to Be Blue. She began to trot, turning right at the top of the hill.<br><br>The shadows were soft and dark here on the Point. Nell slowed down, looking at all the houses, trying to figure where she was in relation to the beach. Her parents had talked about this place, but never brought her here. Their family lived in Atlanta and vacationed on the beautiful Georgia barrier islands.<br><br>Nell was used to southern white sand beaches and soft green grasses and warm water . . . nothing like this jagged coast, the chilly Long Island Sound. A craggy bay showed through the trees of the yards on the left. Some of the gardens were beautiful, overflowing with roses and lilies. A few had flagpoles. The breeze was blowing, and the flags stood out. Some of the flag houses had lovely window boxes cascading with petunias and ivy.<br><br>Suddenly, looking up the hill that rose to the right, Nell saw a different kind of yard. It was mostly rock, with patches of wild-looking grass filling in between bushes and trees. Lilies bloomed in the shade, scraps of yellow and orange, like birds hiding in the woods. Pine needles and oak leaves rustled overhead, and stonecrop thatched in the crevices of stone steps curving up the rocky hill. Nell's heart began to beat very hard when she saw the sign:<br>please go away<br>It was hand-lettered, white paint on gray driftwood, nailed to a stake and driven into the ground beside the steps. Nell raised her eyes from the sign to the house. It was painted white, but the white looked almost blue in the shade of two tall oak trees.<br><br>Nell looked back at the sign. Then at the house. She heard Peggy's words about the lady being a witch, and felt a tug-of-war inside. What if she was mean and scary and put a spell on her? The possibility gave Nell a cold shiver.<br><br>But some feelings are stronger than fear: love, longing, desire. She had a lump in her throat and couldn't shake it loose. Her feet began to walk up the hill, and then she started to run. Staring upward, she saw a face in the window. She felt afraid, but she couldn't stop now. Barefoot, she caught her toe on a rock in the yard, tumbled head over heels, skinned both her knees.<br>Stevie Moore had been at her kitchen table, watercolor brush poised as she stared out the window at hummingbirds darting in and out of the trumpet vine. Her seventeen-year-old cat, Tilly, sat on the table beside her, no less intent. Stevie wanted to capture the hummingbird's essence, which she thought was its amazing ability to be purely still yet in constant motion, all at the same time. Tilly just wanted to capture the hummingbird.<br><br>Stevie really didn't know how she would survive without Tilly. The cat had been Stevie's constant companion through everything. Tilly had gotten her through more lonely nights than she could ever count. Sighing with love for her cat, she saw the hummingbirds suddenly dart away. Looking toward the stairs, she saw a child running up the hill.<br><br>"Tilly, don't schools teach kids to read anymore?" Stevie asked, wondering whether maybe her nemeses, the young boys next door, had stolen her sign again.</p><h2>An Introduction to the Gothic Language (Ancient Language Resources)</h2><p>&#34;The present work is designed to provide a carefully graded introduction to the grammar and vocabulary of the Gothic language. The material is presented in a way that I have found very effective in my teaching of other languages over the years, with enough examples and exercise material to lead the student to a rapid and intelligent reading of the extant texts. &#34;In addition to this purely practical goal, I have also tried to clarify, to the extent possible, the aspectual nature of the Gothic verb, a subject somewhat neglected in the textbooks currently available in English. . . . &#34;Because the study of Gothic is usually undertaken by students of Germanic or Indo-European philology, I have included a discussion of the historical phonology and morphology in a supplementary series of lessons whose contents parallel that of the corresponding lessons in the Grammar. . . . &#34;The texts given include all extant portions of the four gospels together with the extant portions of Romans and First Timothy. The Gospel According to Luke has been fully glossed at the foot of each page to spare the student the loss of time in looking up words . . . . The end Glossary contains the complete vocabulary of the Gothic Bible with the exception of proper names and a few transliterated Greek words.&#34; --from the Preface</p><p></p><h2>Antony and Cleopatra</h2><p><p><b>From the prizewinning author of <i>Caesar </i>and <i>How Rome Fell,</i> a major new account of the&nbsp;charged&nbsp;love affair between Antony and Cleopatra, richly informed by military and political history</b><br><br> A masterfully told&#x2014;and deeply human&#x2014;story of love, politics, and ambition, Adrian Goldsworthy&#x2019;s <i>Antony and Cleopatra </i>delivers a compelling reassessment of a major episode in ancient history.</p><p>In this remarkable dual biography of the two great lovers of the ancient world, Goldsworthy goes beyond myth and romance to create a nuanced and historically acute portrayal of his subjects, set against the political backdrop of their time. A history of lives lived intensely at a time when the world was changing profoundly, the book takes readers on a journey that crosses cultures and boundaries from ancient Greece and ancient Egypt to the Roman Empire.</p><p>Drawing on his prodigious knowledge of the ancient world and his keen sense of the period&#x2019;s military and political history, Goldsworthy creates a singular portrait of the iconic lovers. &#x201c;Antony and Cleopatra were first and foremost political animals,&#x201d; explains Goldsworthy, who places politics and ideology at the heart of their storied romance. Undertaking a close analysis of ancient sources and archaeological evidence, Goldsworthy bridges the gaps of current scholarship and dispels misconceptions that have entered the popular consciousness. He explains why Cleopatra was consistently portrayed by Hollywood as an Egyptian, even though she was really Greek, and argues that Antony had far less military experience than anyone would suspect from reading Shakespeare and other literature. Goldsworthy makes an important case for understanding Antony as a powerful Roman senator and political force in his own right.</p></p><p><b>Adrian Goldsworthy</b> is a leading historian of the ancient world.

Goldsworthy is also the recipient of numerous prizes. He lives in Wales."[Goldsworthy] tells the story of [Cleopatra''s] dynasty with huge skill. . . .

From classic pastoral themes both lyrical and reflective, to a verse play, to a dramatic narrative and the manic, entertaining, prescient ravings of Berry&#x2019;s Mad Farmer, these poems show a unity of language and consciousness, skill and sensitivity, that has placed Wendell Berry at the front rank of contemporary American poets.</p></p><p>"Love the world. Work for nothing. / Take all that you have and be poor. / Love someone who does not deserve it," writes Wendell Berry in the persona of "the mad farmer," a conservative landsman who deeply opposes the then-current war in Vietnam and the ongoing crisis of farming and the environment. Lyric, satiric, didactic, by turns funny and earnest, the poems collected in <i>Farming</i>, most from the late 1960s, established Berry as a social critic and artist of the first order.</p><h2>The Theology of Augustine: An Introductory Guide to His Most Important Works</h2><p>Most theology students realize Augustine is tremendously influential on the Christian tradition as a whole, but they generally lack real knowledge of his writings. This volume introduces Augustine&#39;s theology through seven of his most important works. Matthew Levering begins with a discussion of Augustine&#39;s life and times and then provides a full survey of the argument of each work with bibliographical references for those who wish to go further. Written in clear, accessible language, this book offers an essential introduction to major works of Augustine that all students of theology--and their professors!--need to know.</p><p>"Matthew Levering introduces Augustine through seven of his most important texts--a wonderful idea. Augustine shines out as one whose theology focuses on the central mystery of the Christian faith, God's gracious drawing of humanity into the divine life through the work of the incarnate Word and the life-giving Spirit. Levering's treatment beautifully complements existing introductions, providing a guide that should aid generations of students and inspire the interested lay reader."<br>--<b>Lewis Ayres</b>, Bede Chair in Catholic Theology, Durham University<br><br>"Levering offers to students the best introduction to Augustine devised so far. He makes clear that Augustine himself was no 'Augustinian'; even though he invented subjective angst and had an acute sense of sin, Augustine was also a humanist and a profound metaphysician.

Does God like to paint? Does God ever cry, Papa?" Her parents' responses, based on the Psalms, help Katrina to know God in ways that are very real to her.<br><br>Poetic text and bright impressionistic illustrations combine beautifully to make this a gentle and affirming picture book that will encourage a child's exploration of God. Ideal for reading aloud.<br></p><p>Nancy White Carlstrom is the author of more than 50 booksfor children, including the popular Jesse Bear books (Simon&amp; Schuster) and the best-selling Does God Know How toTie Shoes? (Eerdmans).A conversation between Katrina and her parents about the nature of God deftly juxtaposes an adult metaphysical sensibility (replete with allusions to the book of Psalms) against a child's hands-on approach to spirituality. For instance, in answer to her daughter's question whether God has any pets, Mama replies: "The animals and birds of the forest are his and every cow on a thousand hills," whereas Katrina's more pragmatic response is: "Maybe God would like us to get a a puppy!" Each turn of the page introduces a new question--what God wears, whether He talks, if He cries or sings--and another vista featuring McElrath-Eslick's bold brush strokes and her perhaps overexcited palette. The approach is nondenominational beyond its Judeo-Christian foundations, and could easily provide a springboard for family or one-on-one discussions. All of the Psalms alluded to are included in their entirety at the end of the book.

Crumb and Art Spiegelman&#x201d; (<em>Economist</em>) comes a monumental, wordless depiction of the most infamous day of World War I.</strong></p><p>Launched on July 1, 1916, the Battle of the Somme has come to epitomize the madness of the First World War. Almost 20,000 British soldiers were killed and another 40,000 were wounded that first day, and there were more than one million casualties by the time the offensive halted. In <em>The Great War</em>, acclaimed cartoon journalist Joe Sacco depicts the events of that day in an extraordinary, 24-foot- long panorama: from General Douglas Haig and the massive artillery positions behind the trench lines to the legions of soldiers going &#x201c;over the top&#x201d; and getting cut down in no-man&#x2019;s-land, to the tens of thousands of wounded soldiers retreating and the dead being buried en masse. Printed on fine accordion-fold paper and packaged in a deluxe slipcase with a 16-page booklet, <em>The Great War</em> is a landmark in Sacco&#x2019;s illustrious career and allows us to see the War to End All Wars as we&#x2019;ve never seen it before.</p> 24 plates</p><p>Joe Sacco&#39;s acclaimed books include Palestine, Safe Area Gorazde, and Footnotes in Gaza, as well as a best-selling collaboration with Chris Hedges, Days of Destruction, Days of Revolt. He lives in Portland, Oregon.*Starred Review* What photos exist of WWI tend to be claustrophobic and grainy, which makes Sacco&#x2019;s epic panorama feel all the more revelatory. Illustrated across a single, wordless 24-foot-long accordion-fold page, Sacco details&#x2014;and detail is the right word&#x2014;the situation on July 1, 1916, as British troops meet the Germans at the Battle of the Somme in France. Paged through like a book, it breaks into 12 double-page spreads of astonishingly deep focus, as we follow, from a three-quarter overhead angle, the progression of British forces rightward (that is, eastward), from horseback generals and their comfortable ch�teaus to chow lines bothered by just a hint of distant frontline smoke; from the labyrinth of trenches to the vortex of shell explosions and the resultant gore; and, at last, from the medic station, featuring new trenches&#x2014;graves&#x2014;to the ominous sight of incoming reinforcements. Unfurled, this condensed picture of the western front is one of staggering grandeur and inescapable doom: those lean-faced soldiers at the far left have no idea of the meat grinder that awaits. A separate 16-page booklet provides invaluable annotations as well as Hochschild&#x2019;s fine essay on this disastrous day of battle. Though the format is a bit treacherous for library collections, this is on par with Jacques Tardi&#x2019;s unforgettable graphic works It Was the War of the Trenches (2010) and Goddamn This War! (2013). --Daniel Kraus</p><h2>The Castle Mystery (36) (The Boxcar Children Mysteries)</h2><p>The Boxcar Children are visiting a castle!

These landscapes have a unique historical significance due to the design elements and spiritual meanings that have been traced to the yards and gardens of American slaves and further back to their prior African heritage. These deceptively casual or whimsical foliage arrangements are subtle and symbolic reminders of the divine in everyday life, the cycles of nature, and implied right and wrong ways to live. In the spirit of outsider&#x201d; art traditions, blues musical roots, and other such folk manifestations, these gardens have a unique aesthetic and cultural significance. Over 20 years in the making, this is the first collection of fine art photography to document this subject and, as such, it adds greatly to our understanding and appreciation of this disappearing element of African American culture.</p><p></p><h2>The Diary of a Russian Priest (English and Russian Edition)</h2><p>Alexander Elchaninov, one of the most gifted priests of the Russian emigration, died from a tragic illness in 1934, at the age of fifty-three. In his early years he was involved in the cultural and religious movements which transformed the country&#39;s literature and art during the period of 1900-1910. He was ordained comparatively late in life, after passing through the harrowing experience of the 1917 revolution. While deeply rooted in the spiritual and ascetic tradition of the Orthodox Church, Father Alexander remained close to the intellectual movement of his day. Because Fr Alexander came to the priesthood through the gates of secular culture, this book will be of particular value to all struggling to live the Christian life in an increasingly secular and materialistic world. He writes on themes of universal concern on sin and nervous disease, on marriage, on the meaning of art, on facing illness and death.</p><p>Text: English, Russian (translation)</p><h2>Moonshell Beach: A Shelter Bay Novel</h2><p><b>He no longer believed in anything. <br>But she believed in him.</b><br><br>J.T.

Slavery offers immense profits at minimal risk through the exploitation of vulnerable subclasses whose brutalization is tacitly accepted by the current global economic order. Kara has developed a business and economic analysis of slavery based on metrics and data that attest to the enormous scale and functioning of these systems of exploitation.

By looking at a person&#x2019;s face, you can gain valuable insight into their personality, health, and how they navigate in the world. <br><br>In this illustrated guide, Jennifer Lamonica reveals the sacred tradition of face morphology, an esoteric system that has been passed quietly from rabbi to student as an unbroken oral tradition for more than 4,500 years. She explores the history and development of this ancient art from its origins in Israel and Egypt to its use as the major diagnostic system in Europe until the Enlightenment and its current applications in French medical schools. Sharing the techniques of master face readers, the author details how to read the angles of the profile, as well as palm color and nose shape, to determine a person&#x2019;s temperament, providing health and career insight into each of the four temperaments, including nutritional needs, digestive issues, sleep patterns, health predispositions, and ideal occupational paths. Exploring the Foursquare diagram, developed by French occultist Papus, for highly accurate and detailed facial readings, she explains how to read the front face in combination with planetary shapes, which reveal a person&#x2019;s character; the major facial features, such as eyebrows, which reveal personal inclinations; and the musculature of the face, including expressions, which reveals a person&#x2019;s current mental state.

For more than three decades, I have had the distinct privilege of evaluating patients using the ancient, sacred art of face morphology, or face reading, as it is often called. This book reveals the ancient understanding of the secrets of the soul held within the structure of the face. My intention in compiling and sharing this information is that it further enables us to have an objective awareness of our own personality, inclinations, and tendencies, both biological and psychological. <br><br>As this is a sacred art, care must be given when reading an individual. It is important to get the permission of the individual before reading and reporting what you see in his or her morphology. During the course of my practice I&#x2019;ve received permission from my patients to read their face, usually as part of my initial examination. Here is a surprising example of what one might discover using face morphology. It comes from the very early days in my face morphology career. <br><br><i>One day a new patient walks into my office. I greet her and bring her in for an examination. I ask her if I have permission to read her face, since it would help to explain a bit more about her problem. I also explain to her a little bit about face morphology. She heartily gives me permission to read her face, which most patients do, since everyone is interested in learning about themselves. Within a few minutes, this is what comes blurting out of my mouth, "Who did you murder?" I had taken a leap in trusting what the face was telling me, but I did not expect the answer that she gave. She said, &#x201c;My husband.&#x201d; And of course, as I could see that she was in my office and not in prison, the judge deemed it to be self-defense.</i> <br><br>From that point forward, I began to see the rich efficacy of face reading. I&#x2019;ve experienced countless other revelations with patients over the years which have allowed me to help them deepen their understanding of themselves.<br><br><b>Chapter 1. Introduction to the Four Temperaments <br></b><br>The study of face morphology largely refers to the bony structure that is inherited. When discussing face morphology, we refer to temperament, which is read in layers, beginning with the profile.<br><br>There are four temperaments defined in face morphology: two are considered active (the Bilious and the Sanguine) and two are considered passive (the Nervous and the Lymphatic).<br><br>In this chapter, we examine the four temperaments, each of which is analogous to one of the faces of the four creatures on each of the four posts in Ezekiel&#x2019;s vision. It bears repeating that the Bilious represents the angel/man, the Nervous the eagle, the Sanguine the lion, and the Lymphatic the ox. In the pages ahead, short lists introduce each of the four temperaments. In these lists I mean to highlight some of the foremost features of people with that particular temperament. In my discussion, I also describe some of the common medical problems of each temperament and how the problems are most effectively treated. <br><br>I hasten to add, however, that we are, each of us, all four temperaments, even though we are predominantly one and have the others as, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary qualities. Further, we all live by a 24 hour clock, and there are times in the day, which are defined as quaternary, whereby a person can have the most benefit from their own temperament. This relates to each temperament and the particular time that would be best for each of them. <br><br>We begin with the Bilious temperament, which is the only temperament that shares two layers of the four dermal derivations. The Bilious type derives from the chordoblast (a combination of mesodermal and ectodermal layers) and the ectoblast. As with all the temperaments, I open with brief notes on major characteristics of the Bilious type to familiarize the reader with the particular quarter of the day, season, and disposition that is most relevant to the personality and activity of this type. <br><br><b>The Bilious Profile <br></b><br>When reading the Bilious profile from the left side as is the convention, notice that the forehead can be pouched forward like the shape of a reverse question mark. The range from an extreme pouch, to a lesser pouch, all the way to a straight line from the nasal bridge to the hairline is included in the Bilious profile. The jaw line (the outline of the mandible from the ear to the chin) comes down about two-thirds of the way to the chin; and the back of the head is like a bowling ball.<br><br>The Bilious have an active, intellectual, objective outlook. They seek the actual and the concrete, and are effective gatherers of knowledge. They make things happen. They are constructors. They also may be willing to stretch the truth to serve their plan. <br><br>The Bilious are a chordoblastic, medium-built people. They have black complected hair on their head, and the palms of their hands are often dark. From the back of the head they tend to look like a bowling ball. They have short compact muscles and need to be physical. They are very impatient with pain, and they tend to have more bone problems than do the other three temperaments. <br><br>The Bilious types prefer cold, wet environments. They do not like to rest. They have stamina and like to keep going. They are excellent marathon runners. They need chlorophyll for oxygenation, and they need ozone. They have a great ability to utilize oxygen and burn it. Bilious thinking is not abstract. It is concrete, constructive, coordinated, controlled, organized, and they like things to be done to their exact wishes.<br><br>The Bilious temperament likes a challenge and enjoys being victorious. Due to their strong will, sometimes they can exact claims and power over other people, which can be difficult in relationships with people of a more passive type.</p><h2>Greater than Ever: New York&#39;s Big Comeback</h2><p><b>The former deputy mayor of New York City tells the story of the city's comeback after 9/11, offering lessons in resiliency under the most trying of circumstances, and a model for the rejuvenation of any city.</b><br> Deputy Mayor Daniel L. Doctoroff led New York's dramatic and unexpected economic resurgence after the September 11 terrorist attacks. With Mayor Michael Bloomberg, he developed a remarkably ambitious five-borough economic development plan to not only recover from the attacks but to completely transform New York's economy: New neighborhoods were created. Hundreds of thousands of jobs were generated. The largest municipal affordable housing plan in American history was completed. Ground Zero was rebuilt. And New York adopted a pathbreaking sustainability plan.<br>None of this was straightforward. New York has some of the most entrenched financial and political interests anywhere, and it has a population that is quick to let its public officials know exactly what is on its mind. Doctoroff's plans for a New York Olympic Games and a stadium on the West Side crashed and burned, but phoenix-like he engineered the transformation of the city anyway.<br><i>Greater than Ever</i> is a bracing adventure--when can-do attitude dove headlong into New York's unique realpolitik of "fuggedaboutit"--during which the city was changed for the better.</p><p><b>Dan Doctoroff</b> is the founder and chief executive officer of Sidewalk Labs, an Alphabet company that works with cities to build products that address big urban problems. Prior to launching Sidewalk, he was CEO and president of Bloomberg LP, the leading provider of financial news and information. From 2002-2008, he was New York City's deputy mayor for economic development and rebuilding. Outside of work, he serves on the boards of the University of Chicago, World Resources Institute, and Human Rights First. He is a founder of Target ALS, an initiative to streamline discovery of new approaches to treating ALS (also known as Lou Gehrig's disease), and a founder and chairman of Culture Shed, New York's newest cultural institution.<br>"Lots of people (like me) write about cities and city-building, Daniel L.

It placed an emphasis on gardening but since then, expanding on its principles, it now includes many other aspects, from building and community design to energy use. It is an interconnecting framework which links a diversity of green ideas. Its aims are a low input, high output efficient use of resources &#x2013; and genuine sustainability.</p> <p><em>The Earth Care Manual</em> gives a vision of a sustainable future and the practical steps we can take towards it, both large and small, urban and rural. The book defines permaculture and places it in the context of the green movement.</p> <p>Written by Patrick Whitefield, one of Europe&#x2019;s foremost teachers and practitioners of temperate permaculture, it explains in depth how to apply permaculture to any situation, from the smallest of buildings or apartments, to houses, gardens, orchards, farms and woodlands. It covers subjects vital to sustainability including food, energy, water, microclimate and shelter.</p></p><p><p>Patrick Whitefield (1949 &#x2013; 2015) was an early pioneer of permaculture, adapting Bill Mollison&#x2019;s teachings with a strong Southern Hemisphere bias to the cooler, maritime climate of the British Isles. He wrote a number of seminal books, including <em>Permaculture in a Nutshell</em> (1993), <em>How to Make a Forest Garden</em> (1996), <em>The Living Landscape</em> (2009), <em>How To Read the Landscape</em> (2014) and his magnum opus, <em>The Earth Care Manual</em> (2004), an authoritative resource on practical, tested, cool temperate permaculture. Patrick appeared in several BBC TV programmes, popular gardening videos, and taught many permaculture and other practical courses, throughout the UK.</p>The Earth Care Manual, put simply, is fantastic. It is what I have been waiting for for years, and it is what those of us in temperate climates have urgently needed. Patrick&#39;s considerable experience in the fields of woodlands and fruit growing shine through especially strongly, but the whole book is rich with vision and experience. What it offers is common sense solutions rooted in the culture and climate of these islands. This book is a clear and unarguable road map to where we need to go, an A-Z to sanity and common sense. Patrick has created a manual with which we can repair this beautiful jewel of a planet which we are fortunate enough to inhabit, and in so doing has given us a truly precious gift.

In these incisive and engaging pages, Kagan responds to those who anticipate&#x2014;or even long for&#x2014;a post-American world order by showing what a decline in America&#x2019;s influence would truly mean for the United States and the rest of the world, as the vital institutions, economies, and ideals currently supported by American power wane or disappear. As Kagan notes, it has happened before: one need only to consider the consequences of the breakdown of the Roman Empire and the collapse of the European order in World War I.

It would be nice if we could do the same for the United States, to see what the world would have looked like had the United States not been the preeminent power shaping it for the past six decades, and to imagine what the world might look like if America were to decline, as so many nowadays predict.<br> &nbsp;<br> We take a lot for granted about the way the world looks today&#x2014;the widespread freedom, the unprecedented global prosperity (even despite the current economic crisis), and the absence of war among great powers. In 1941 there were only a dozen democracies in the world. Today there are over a hundred. For four centuries prior to 1950, global gross domestic product (GDP) rose by less than 1 percent a year. Since 1950 it has risen by an average of 4 percent a year, and billions of people have been lifted out of poverty. The first half of the twentieth century saw the two most destructive wars in the history of mankind, and in prior centuries war among great powers was almost constant. But for the past sixty years no great powers have gone to war with one another. Our era is best known for the war that never happened, between the United States and the Soviet Union.<br> &nbsp;<br> There&#x2019;s plenty wrong with our world, of course, but from the perspective of thousands of years of recorded history, in which war, despotism, and poverty have been the norm, and peace, democracy, and prosperity the rare exceptions, our own era has been a golden age.<br> Some believe this is the inevitable result of human progress, a combination of advancing science and technology, an increasingly global economy, strengthening international institutions, evolving &#x201c;norms&#x201d; of international behavior, and the gradual but inevitable triumph of liberal democracy over other forms of government&#x2014;forces of change that transcend the actions of men and nations.<br> &nbsp;<br> But there is also another possibility. Perhaps the progress we enjoy was not an inevitable evolution of the human species but rather the product of a unique and perhaps fleeting set of circumstances: a particular arrangement of power in the international system that favors a certain worldview over others. Maybe if those conditions were to change, if power were to shift, then the characteristics of the world order would change, too. Perhaps democracy has spread to over a hundred nations since 1950 not simply because people yearn for democracy but because the most powerful nation in the world since 1950 has been a democracy. Perhaps the stunning global economic growth of the past six decades reflects an economic order shaped by the world&#x2019;s leading free-market economy. Perhaps the era of peace we have known has something to do with the enormous power wielded by one nation.<br> &nbsp;<br> History shows that world orders, including our own, are transient. They rise and fall. And the institutions they erected, the beliefs that guided them, and the &#x201c;norms&#x201d; that shaped the relations among nations within them&#x2014;they fall, too. Every international order in history has reflected the beliefs and interests of its strongest powers, and every international order has changed when power shifted to others with different beliefs and interests. On some occasions, the prevailing world order has simply collapsed into disorder. When the Roman Empire fell, the order it supported fell, too. Not just Roman government and law but an entire economic system stretching from northern Europe to North Africa was disrupted and would take centuries to rebuild. Culture, the arts, even progress in science and technology, were set back for centuries. People lost the recipe for cement.<br> &nbsp;<br> We saw a similar collapse of world order in our own time. The world we know today was erected amid the chaos and destruction following World War II and the collapse of the European-dominated order that had evolved over four centuries. That order was far from perfect: it produced many wars, an aggressive imperialism, and the widespread oppression of nonwhite races, but it also produced the conditions for an era of great human advances. By the late nineteenth century British control of the seas and the balance of great powers on the European continent together had provided the relative security and stability to allow a growth in prosperity, a modest if tenuous expansion of personal freedoms, and a world knit closer by the revolutions in commerce and communication we today call globalization. It kept peace among the great powers for almost four decades after the Napoleonic Wars, and for another four decades after the wars of German unification. It was so successful that many concluded at the dawn of the twentieth century that mankind had reached a summit of evolution and that major war and tyranny had become obsolete.<br> &nbsp;<br> Yet with the outbreak of World War I, the age of settled peace and advancing liberalism&#x2014;of European civilization approaching its pinnacle&#x2014;collapsed into an age of hyper-nationalism, despotism, and economic calamity. The once promising spread of democracy and liberalism halted and then reversed course, leaving a handful of outnumbered and besieged democracies living nervously in the shadow of their newly fascist and totalitarian neighbors. Suddenly it was a world filled with predatory leaders sitting atop predatory powers. The collapse of the British and European orders in the twentieth century did not produce a new dark age&#x2014;though if Nazi Germany and imperial Japan had won the war, it might have&#x2014;but the cataclysm it did produce was, in its own way, no less devastating.<br> &nbsp;<br> Would the end of the present American order have less dire consequences? That is a question worth asking now, as so many contemplate the prospect of American decline. A surprising number of American intellectuals, politicians, and policy makers greet that prospect with equanimity. There is a general sense that the end of the era of American preeminence need not mean the end of the present liberal international order. The expectation, if not assumption, is that the good qualities of that order&#x2014;the democracy, the prosperity, the peace among great powers&#x2014;can transcend the decline of American power and influence. Even with diminished American power, the political scientist G. John Ikenberry writes, &#x201c;the underlying foundations of the liberal international order will survive and thrive.&#x201d;2 And there is an accompanying view that American decline is in any case already a fact of life, so whether it is a good thing or a bad thing, there is nothing we can do about it.<br> &nbsp;<br> Against this backdrop, it is worth exploring to what degree the present world order depends on American power and its unique qualities. What would it mean for the future if the international order were no longer shaped primarily by the United States and like-minded allied nations? Who or what would take America&#x2019;s place? And there is another set of questions, equally important: Is America really in decline? Or are Americans in danger of committing preemptive superpower suicide out of a misplaced fear of declining power?<br> &nbsp;<br>&nbsp; <br><br> <b>Meet George Bailey: What is American About the American World Order? <br>&nbsp;</b><br> Why call it the &#x201c;American world order&#x201d; at all? The United States has certainly not shaped the international environment by itself. Many other peoples, as well as broad historical forces&#x2014;the evolution of science and technology, fluctuations in the availability of natural resources, long-term economic trends, population growth&#x2014;have also created today&#x2019;s world. Peoples on every continent have worked and suffered to lift themselves out of poverty and destruction and to make better lives for themselves and their children. The world is too big for any nation to shape by itself. Nevertheless, in any given historical period, the most powerful nations do put their own particular stamp on the international order, if only by virtue of their relative weight in the system. They establish many of the &#x201c;norms&#x201d; and rules of international behavior. They shape the nature of economic relations. They can even have influence in the realm of ideas and beliefs, including the way peoples worship their gods and the forms of government they consider legitimate. For many centuries the predominant power of China shaped the way millions of people throughout Asia thought, spoke, worshipped, painted, and carried on their commerce. In the nineteenth century, the great European powers imposed standards of international and domestic behavior not only for Europeans but for millions throughout Africa, Asia, and Latin America. There has been an Egyptian order, a Roman order, a Greek order, an Islamic order, a Mogul order, an Ottoman order, and many others, and historians will undoubtedly view the period from the end of World War II until some yet to be determined moment as an American order.<br> &nbsp;<br> Yet it has also been the American order in a more specific sense. It is not just that the United States has been the most influential power in the international system. The most important features of today&#x2019;s world&#x2014;the great spread of democracy, the prosperity, the prolonged great-power peace&#x2014;have depended directly and indirectly on power and influence exercised by the United States. No other power could have or would have influenced the world the way Americans have because no other nation shares, or has ever shared, their peculiar combination of qualities.<br> &nbsp;<br> Some of the most important qualities are obvious. America&#x2019;s unique geographical circumstances, its capitalist economic system, its democratic form of government, and its enormous military power have together shaped a particular kind of international order that would have looked very different had another nation with different characteristics wielded a similar amount of influence.<br> &nbsp;<br> Less easy to grasp, but just as important to understanding the nature of the American world order, is the complex character of the American people. This is no simple paean to Americans&#x2019; superior virtues. Some portray Americans as farseeing builders of international institutions and structures of liberal order, as thoughtful &#x201c;operators&#x201d; and &#x201c;managers&#x201d; of vast global systems.3 But few Americans, and few non-Americans, would recognize this portrait. In most respects, Americans are like any other people, with a blend of selfishness and generosity. More than most, they have been a people of contradictory impulses and a most ambivalent view of what role, if any, they ought to play in the world.<br> &nbsp;<br> They are a people rife with potent national myths that both inspire and mislead them. Start with the fact that one of the most powerful, influential, and expansive peoples in history still think of themselves as aloof, passive, self-contained, and generally inclined to minding their own business. In less than two centuries Americans transformed their nation from a sliver of settlement clinging to a coastline into a globe-girdling superpower with historically unparalleled power and influence. Yet to hear Americans tell it, they are the Greta Garbo of nations: they just want to be left alone. In their national mythology, the two-centuries-long subjugation of the North American continent, a region inhabited by Spaniards, French, and Russians, as well as by an entire race of indigenous peoples, was not conquest but the peaceful settlement of an empty frontier. Americans do not go &#x201c;abroad in search of monsters to destroy&#x201d; is the oft-quoted phrase of John Quincy Adams. If someone points out to them that they have, indeed, often done just that, then they portray themselves as the &#x201c;reluctant sheriff,&#x201d; their boots on the desk, reading the newspaper until some unsavory gang rides into town and forces them to pull their rifle off its rack, whether Japanese imperialists, Nazis, Soviet communists, or Islamic jihadis. &#x201c;The United States of America never goes to war because we want to,&#x201d; said one prominent politician a few years ago. &#x201c;We only go to war because we have to.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> But this self-perception, while sincere, bears no relation to reality. Since the late nineteenth century, when the United States became a world power, Americans have used force dozens of times, and rarely because they had no choice.5 They have sent troops to Mexico and Central America to depose troublesome leaders; they have fought the Spanish in Cuba and independence-minded guerrillas in the Philippines; they have fought anti-Western forces in China and communists in Vietnam and Korea, and have sent millions of troops to Europe, twice; they have fought dictators and jihadis in the Middle East, Central Asia, and Africa. And they have done so for many reasons: to defend themselves from distant threats, to preserve economic interests, to protect peoples from slaughter, to resist aggression, to fight tyranny, to support democracy. Far more than any other democratic people in the world today, Americans see war as a legitimate, even essential, tool of foreign policy.6 Few modern nations, and no modern democracies, more revere their military heroes, both past and present. But every time they go to war, Americans promise themselves they&#x2019;ll never do it again.<br> &nbsp;<br> They are even ambivalent about the cause of democracy, with which they have always been so closely identified. Americans, even in Woodrow Wilson&#x2019;s day, never had a master plan for making the world over in their image. They have often ignored the dictators in their midst, allied with them, aided them, and done business with them. They are not missionaries. But neither have they been able to escape their democratic identity, their democratic conscience, and their conviction that their special cause is, as Ben Franklin said, the &#x201c;cause of all mankind.&#x201d; To be an American is to believe in and be committed to what Americans, and only Americans, like to call &#x201c;our way of life.&#x201d; Since they believe their founding principles are universal, they measure all other peoples against the same rigid standard. This highly ideological view of the world tells them that all nondemocratic governments are inherently illegitimate and therefore transient. Even John Quincy Adams, in the same speech in which he warned against seeking monsters to destroy, urged the peoples of Europe to follow the American example and mount revolutions against centuries-old monarchies: &#x201c;Go thou and do likewise!&#x201d;</p><h2>Uneasy Lies the Crown: A Lady Emily Mystery (Lady Emily Mysteries, 13)</h2><p><p><b>In <i>Uneasy Lies the Crown, </i>the thrilling new mystery in Tasha Alexander's bestselling series, Lady Emily and her husband Colin must stop a serial killer whose sights may be set on the new king, Edward VII.</b></p><p>On her deathbed, Queen Victoria asks to speak privately with trusted agent of the Crown, Colin Hargreaves, and slips him a letter with one last command: <i>Une sanz pluis.

MONTGOMERY attended Hopkins Grammar School, Williston-Northampton School and Williams College where he graduated in 1958. He pursued graduate studies in Religion and Economics at Yale and NYU. Montgomery was an adventurer all his life, climbing mountains in the Himalaya, skiing throughout Europe and scuba-diving wherever he could. His interested included education, macro-economics, geo-politics, mythology, history, mystery novels and music. He wrote his first interactive book, Journey Under the Sea, in 1976 and published it under the series name The Adventures of You. A few years later Bantam Books bought this book and gave Montgomery a contract for five more, to inaugurate their new children s publishing division. Bantam renamed the series Choose Your Own Adventure and a publishing phenomenon was born. The series has sold more than 260 million copies in over 40 languages. He was married to the writer Shannon Gilligan.

By adolescence, such negative attitudes have produced and reinforced a single, powerful emotion: shame, the feeling that you&#x2019;re inferior and judged as &#x201c;bad,&#x201d; for what you are&#x2014;gay.<br><br> In <i>Coming out of Shame</i> Gershen Kaufman and Lev Raphael expose the role shame has come to play in gay and lesbian lives. Rarely discussed but vastly important, shame powerfully shapes each individual&#x2019;s development of self-esteem, identity, and intimacy&#x2014;three areas in which gay men and lesbians have been extremely vulnerable to the crippling effects of shame. Tracing the historical and cultural sources of gay shame, Kaufman and Raphael reveal how gay men and lesbians have internalized shame, resulting in self-loathing and destructive behaviors. <br><br> The hallmark of shame is silence, and by breaking the silence around the dynamics of gay shame, Kaufman and Raphael offer a way to &#x201c;come out&#x201d; of shame and begin the journey toward wholeness and self-acceptance. Filled with the experiences of those struggling to overcome shame, <i>Coming Out of Shame</i> includes strategies for:<br><br>�&nbsp;Storing self-esteem<br>�&nbsp;Creating a positive gay identity<br>�&nbsp;Healing scenes of shame<br>�&nbsp;Developing partnerships in intimacy<br> &nbsp;<br> Self-affirming and inspirational, <i>Coming Out of Shame</i> guides the transformation of gay shame into gay pride and empowers gay men and lesbians as no other book has done.</p><p><b>Gershon Kaufman, PhD,&nbsp;</b>is the author of several works on the subject of shame including, <i>Coming Out of Shame: Transforming Gay and Lesbian Lives</i>. He is a professor at Michigan State University and lectures on shame and self-esteem.<br><br><b>Lev Raphael, PhD,</b>&nbsp;is the author of several works including a collection of short stories, <i>Dancing on Tisha B&#x2019;Av. </i>He teaches creative writing, popular literature, and Jewish American literature at Michigan State University.Psychologist and psychotherapist Kaufman (Shame: The Power of Caring, Shenckman, 1981) has been publishing on shame for two decades; Raphael, his life partner of ten years, is best known for his fiction (Winter Eyes, St. Martin's, 1992). Together they present the main features of shame theory based on the work of Silvan Tomkins; they then move on to examine how internalized shame and fear impact on self-esteem, identity, and intimacy, specifically in the life experiences of lesbians and gay men. Maintaining that the self is continuously evolving, the authors offer "reparenting" imagery to transform scenes in an attempt to help make patterns of emotion more visible and thus diminish shame in individuals and relationships, as well as facilitate resolution of such issues as sexual monogamy. The use of humor and examples from case studies help mitigate the text's redundancy. The technical terminology somewhat obscures the many insights in this book clearly intended for the sophisticated layperson. For public collections strong on gay issues.?James E.

This unusual picture book follows the seventeenth-century poet Basho on a journey across Japan. Based on his journal of prose and poetry, this is no travelogue, but a reflection on what the poet saw, what he did, and who he met as he traveled. With the exception of a verse by Issa, the haiku that appear in the book are Basho's own. While the text is agreeable enough, the book's page design and artwork are exceptional in their refreshing sense of freedom and spontaneity. An illustration note identifies the medium as colored ink applied with brushes, evidently on rice paper, but this doesn't begin to suggest the pictures' exquisite clarity of line and purity of color. Though surely inspired by Japanese art, the paintings are suffused with Demi's own sense of page design, decorative art, and good humor. Each double-page spread includes a segment of the story, a painting of Basho on his journey, a haiku reflecting some aspect of the text, and a word that appears in three forms: a painted Japanese character, its transliteration, and its translation into English. The Japanese characters are cogent visual expressions of concepts such as river, fire, or world. The same word appears in the haiku on that spread. A beautiful book and a fine resource for children studying haiku. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i></p><h2>It Had to Be Done: The Navajo Code Talkers Remember World War II</h2><p>In early 1942, during the darkest months following the bombing of Pearl Harbor, a group of 29 Navajo Marines, young and fresh out of boot camp, were taken into a room with bars on the windows and a guard at the door. Their task: devise a top-secret code that would thwart the sharpest cryptanalytic minds in Imperial Japan. And they succeeded. This book documents their staggering wartime achievement: the formation and use of the Navajo Code. But the book is also about the lives of eight Navajo Code Talkers, told in their own words: the difficult living conditions faced during their childhood, and their boarding school experiences where the Navajo language was strictly sometimes brutally suppressed. This is their story. It&#39;s a story about a code of humble origins; a code that the most brilliant minds were unable to break; a code that saved thousands of American lives in World War 2. It&#39;s a story about their hazardous duty from Guadalcanal to Iwo Jima and Okinawa often performed under murderous enemy fire, with some paying the ultimate price. It&#39;s a story about intelligence, courage, and ultimately, about patriotism. Softcover, 7 x 10 inches, 96 pages, b/w illustrations, index. Appendices include the Navajo Code and a list of all known Navajo Code Talkers. This book was written with the cooperation of members of the Navajo Code Talkers Association.

Even so, let&#x2019;s face it: you could be a better person. We all could. But what does that mean for you?<br> &nbsp;<br> In a world full of suffering and deprivation, it&#x2019;s easy to despair&#x2014;and it&#x2019;s also easy to judge ourselves for not doing more. Even if we gave away everything we own and devoted ourselves to good works, it wouldn&#x2019;t solve all the world&#x2019;s problems. It would make them better, though. So is that what we have to do? Is anything less a moral failure? Can we lead a fundamentally decent life without taking such drastic steps?<br> &nbsp;<br> Todd May has answers. He&#x2019;s not the sort of philosopher who tells us we have to be model citizens who display perfect ethics in every decision we make. He&#x2019;s realistic: he understands that living up to ideals is a constant struggle. In <i>A Decent Life</i>, May leads readers through the traditional philosophical bases of a number of arguments about what ethics asks of us, then he develops a more reasonable and achievable way of thinking about them, one that shows us how we can use philosophical insights to participate in the complicated world around us. He explores how we should approach the many relationships in our lives&#x2014;with friends, family, animals, people in need&#x2014;through the use of a more forgiving, if no less fundamentally serious, moral compass. With humor, insight, and a lively and accessible style, May opens a discussion about how we can, realistically, lead the good life that we aspire to.<br> &nbsp;<br> A philosophy of goodness that leaves it all but unattainable is ultimately self-defeating. Instead, Todd May stands at the forefront of a new wave of philosophy that sensibly reframes our morals and redefines what it means to live a decent life.</p><p>Todd May&nbsp;is the Class of 1941 Memorial Professor of the Humanities at Clemson University. He is the author of many books, including <i>A Fragile Life </i>and <i>A Significant Life</i>, both also published by the University of Chicago Press.<p>"While no one would confuse it for light reading, May&#x2019;s style is conversational, frequently funny and overall, he comes across as a very, shall we say, decent guy. May&#x2019;s book is not prescriptive but is actually something better: a meditation on how striving for decency is a route towards personal satisfaction and happiness, even in a world that may seem to disadvantage the decent.&nbsp;. . . The book acknowledges the complexity of human beings and the world at large and offers a way of thinking about those complexities without falling into the dreaded trap of 'moral relativism.' Put simply, I am a better person for having read this book."</p> (John Warner <i>Chicago Tribune</i>)<br><br>"Most of us are not 'moral monsters,' argues May; nor do we 'strive to be moral saints.' The different schools of traditional moral philosophy put the stress on intentions, consequences of 'virtue ethics,' yet none is very useful for the vast majority of people who want to be decent without aspiring to total altruism.&nbsp;<i>A Decent Life</i>&nbsp;explores what this might mean in practice with regard to our relationships with family and friends; the strangers we run into; nonhuman animals; and the political sphere. It concludes with Nine Rules for Moral Decency, including 'Enjoy reading philosophy, even when it advises you to to be better than you can reasonably be.'" (<i>Times Higher Education</i>)<br><br>"May has a knack for presenting philosophical concepts in ways that are easily graspable, and his advice for living 'a life with a goal more modest than altruism, but better than moral mediocrity' makes such a goal seem attainable for a wide audience. Anyone interested in living a more morally conscious life will want to give this wise guide a look."<br> &nbsp; (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>)<br><br>"In the face of great injustice or radical indecency, it is tempting to give up our moral lives altogether. The challenges of being good seem impossibly daunting. Todd May has given us just a little bit of hope--a few practical suggestions for becoming just a little bit more decent.&nbsp;<i>A Decent Life</i>&nbsp;is the kind of book I will give to my students--or to my daughter: a humble, down-to-earth primer for living ethically in a world that seems intent on destroying itself. May has written a more-than-decent book. It is genuinely good." (John Kaag, author of Hiking with Nietzsche: On Becoming Who You Are)<br><br>"Some philosophers have argued that morality requires us repeatedly to sacrifice our wealth and pleasure for the sake of others, including distant strangers and even animals. Recognizing that most people believe otherwise and are unwilling to live this way, Todd May offers an alternative, more realistic vision of the moral life that is neither saintly nor heroic but nonetheless <i>decent</i>. In writing that is lucid and enlivened by stories drawn from his own and other people's experiences, he reveals how, by showing appropriate respect for the fact that others (including animals) have lives of their own to live, we can satisfy the demands of morality while retaining our ability to have fulfilling and meaningful lives. Particularly in its discussion of our relations with political opponents, this book is a timely, illuminating, and inspiring work of moral philosophy." (Jeff McMahan, University of Oxford)<br><br>"Moral philosophy often appears either as a very technical discipline or as a set of demands to be altruistic that few if any of us can realize. In this book, Todd May articulates the extremely appealing idea of a decent life as an alternative. He writes with the clarity of an analytical philosopher, but about existential themes that are usually addressed by continental thinkers. The book is almost completely without technical language, full of thought-provoking examples from everyday life, and it will be an edifying read for everyone who aspires to be a decent human being."

In its grasp of life's frailty and its portrayal of one of the great literary romances of this century, <i>Elegy for Iris</i> is a mesmerizing work of art that will be read for generations.</p></p><p>In one of literary history's ghastlier ironies, Iris Murdoch, the author of such highly intellectual and philosophical novels as <i>A Severed Head</i> and <i>Under the Net</i>, was diagnosed in 1994 with Alzheimer's disease, which slowly destroys reasoning powers, memory, even the ability to speak coherently. Her husband, English literary critic John Bayley, unsparingly depicts his wife's affliction in prose as elegant and accessible as hers always was. Readers may wince at the spectacle of Murdoch glued to the TV watching the <i>Teletubbies</i> program, unable to perform tasks as simple as dressing herself and prey to devastating anxiety as the world becomes less and less comprehensible to her. We understand Bayley's occasional fits of rage when his caretaking chores overwhelm him. Yet in the end his memoir is touching, even inspiring. As he recalls their first meetings and marriage in the 1950s, it becomes clear that theirs was always an unconventional union, in which solitude was as important to each of them as togetherness and Bayley was content to let Murdoch keep her inner life to herself. He loves Iris, the woman, not the intellect, and he conveys an essential sweetness about his wife that endures even as her mental faculties deteriorate. This totally unsentimental account of their life and her illness is nonetheless a heartbreaker. <i>--Wendy Smith</i>"This splendid book enlarges our imagination of the range and possibilities of love." --Mary Gordon, <i>The New York Times</i><p> "Without a hint of sentimentality, treats hopelessly sad things in a manner that celebrates eternal human verity...Magnificently, hauntingly humane." --Michael Pakenham, <i>The Baltimore Sun</i></p><p> "Bayley's restrained and elegant love song to his wife of 42 years...is beautiful and heartbreaking.

And the food must be digested somehow in the rumbling, squeezing stomach and intestines before the body can use it. What really happens in there? Over two hundred years ago a famous Italian scientist named Lazzaro Spallanzani tried to find out. He had no X-rays or cameras with fiber-optic tubes to look inside a person's digestive tract, as we do now, but he had his own bold ideas. He could use materials as simple as linen and wood to solve the riddles of digestion. Would he find evidence of grinding, rotting, or chemical changes no one had discovered before? <br> <br>When young Lazarro was growing up in Scandiano, Italy, he knew nothing of science. At fifteen he went away to a college run by the Jesuit religious order. He studied languages, philosophy, speaking, and writing, and impressed his teachers so much that they asked him to join their order. But his father, a lawyer, wanted him to study law. <br> <br>So Lazarro went to the University of Bologna. Studying law trained him to think logically, but he didn't like it. Fortunately, one of his cousins, Laura Bassi, was a professor there. She encouraged him to take a wider variety of courses, including chemistry, physics, natural history (nature studies), and math. He was impressed with the power of mathematics, but it was the sciences that awakened his passion. Professor Bassi and another teacher persuaded Lazarro's father to let him drop law. Thus began Lazarro Spallanzani's amazing career in science. <br> <br>By the time Spallanzani took up his digestion experiments in about 1776, he was a professor of natural history at the university in Pavia, Italy. He was already famous for his extraordinary experiments on other subjects. For example, he had aimed sunbeams at salamanders in a dark room so that he could watch their blood flow under a microscope. He had boldly climbed the Italian mountains to study their gushing spring water. To test the story that there was a giant whirlpool in the middle of Lake Ventasso in the Apennines mountain range, he floated out to the spot on a raft made of tree stumps. (Conclusion: no whirlpool.) <br> <br>Now about forty-seven years old, Spallanzani was still full of energy, and his brain continued to overflow with questions. How do volcanoes erupt? Are sperm needed to make babies? How do deep-sea animals glow in the dark? How do birds migrate? And so on. <br> <br>Spallanzani was fascinated by digestion. Very little was known about it then. Some scientists thought stomachs and intestines were like machines, grinding up food into little bits. Others thought there was a sort of bubbly fermentation occurring, like grape juice turning to wine. Another suggestion was that the food in the digestive system was simply rotting. <br> <br>Only a few scientists had actually done experiments on digestion. In the 1600s, another Italian named Francesco Redi had forced birds to swallow glass balls to test the grinding-machine idea. The glass did indeed get crumbled in the birds' digestive organs. Then, in the 1700s, a Frenchman named Rene de Reaumur studied the chemistry of digestion. He forced some birds to swallow and regurgitate little metal tubes stuffed with sponges and then squeezed their stomach juice out of the sponges for chemical experiments. <br> <br>Spallanzani used these ideas but went much further. He began with chickens, ducks, turkeys, geese, crows, pigeons, and doves. Then he moved on to frogs, newts, snakes, fish, sheep, oxen, horses, owls, eagles, cats, and dogs. <br> <br>Why so many? He knew these animals have wildly different diets and eating "equipment." Chickens have no teeth but do have a very tough, muscular organ called a gizzard, usually full of stones they have swallowed. Cats slash their meat with razor-sharp teeth, while horses use huge, flat molars to mash food and snakes swallow their mouse meals whole. Surely there would be differences in digestion, too. And indeed there were. For example, Spallanzani showed that chickens and turkeys were great grinders. A chicken's gizzard could turn solid glass balls into "sand" in a few hours, and a turkey's gizzard could break metal into bits. <br> <br>Today, some of Spallanzani's animal experiments sound cruel. When he pushed hard objects, such as tin tubes stuffed with food, down the animals' throats, they probably suffered. Some of them even fought back. In his extremely detailed report on the digestion experiments, Spallanzani noted that the snakes became "highly exasperated." One snake, fortunately a nonpoisonous specimen, bit him. Falcons and eagles attempted to attack him. When dogs tried to bite, he decided to hide their food tubes in pieces of meat and throw those on the floor. <br> <br>We should remember, however, that in the 1700s European scientists generally did not believe that animals could think or feel pain. Ordinary people killed many animals for food, hunted them for sport, and worked them hard on farms without much thought about the animals' feelings. Spallanzani's use of animals for science would not have raised any eyebrows in his own time. <br> <br>Spallanazani finished his animal experiments. Then, "not neglecting Man, the noblest and most interesting of all," he started in on his own stomach. He knew that humans might feel discomfort from such experiments, even if he did not realize other animals did, too. He decided that he could not ask another person to submit to his tests--he had to try them on himself. <br> <br>He started with a soft experiment. One morning he chewed a bite of bread, spit it out, and weighed it. He stuffed the chewed bread into a small bag made of linen. The bag would help him track the location of the bread, while letting digestive juices soak into the food. He sewed the opening shut with thread. Then he swallowed the bag. <br> <br>Spallanzani wasn't too worried. He knew that people sometimes swallow cherry stones and plum pits by accident, and they travel all the way through the digestive tract and come out in the feces without doing any harm. Twenty-three hours after Spallanzani swallowed the bread bag, it came out. He was fine. The bag and thread were intact, but the bread was completely gone. <br> <br>"The fortunate result of this experiment gave me great encouragement to undertake others," said Spallanzani. So he forged ahead with a carefully planned series of experiments on himself, including dozens of tests, getting more and more daring. <br> <br>He swallowed bread again inside bags made of two or three layers of cloth to slow down the digestion. The triple-layer bag had a dry speck of bread left in it. Spallanzani tasted it and discovered that it had lost all its flavor. <br> <br>Was the food getting crushed like the glass in a chicken's gizzard? The human stomach and intestines are certainly muscular. To find out if squeezing was essential for digestion, Spallanzani decided to swallow food inside hard capsules. He carved wood into tubes about the size of a modern multivitamin pill, with holes in the sides to let the digestive juices in. If food still got digested inside such a tube, then digestive <i>juices</i> soaking into the food were more important than the mashing. <br> <br>Tubes were scarier than bags. A tube might get stuck in his stomach, or it might tear his organs if he vomited it up. Spallanzani was definitely worried, since he often got indigestion after <i>normal</i> meals. <br> <br>Nevertheless, he filled a wooden tube with chewed veal, put the tube in a linen bag, and swallowed everything. Then he waited. No problem! The food package "exited happily at the end of 22 hours," he reported. Both bag and tube came out intact but empty. His digestive juices seemed to be working even without any squeezing. <br> <br>Spallanzani sent more wooden tubes on the same journey down the esophagus. To study the effect of chewing he put a chewed piece of pigeon heart in one tub and an unchewed piece in another tube, then swallowed both. Much more of the chewed heart had disappeared when the tubes came out the next day. He repeated these experiments with mutton, veal, and bread and got the same results. Chewed food was digested more quickly, probably because the chewed bits got more thoroughly exposed to his digestive juices. <br> <br>Spallanzani carved some tubes especially thin, so that they could easily be crushed with the press of a finger. These tubes always came out of his body unbroken. His digestive organs must be squeezing very gently indeed. <br> <br>To test this idea further, Spallanzani gulped down four firm grapes without chewing. They all came out after a day, still whole. Then he swallowed softer grapes and both firm and soft cherries, and most of them also came out whole. The human digestive system was clearly not a grinding machine. <br> <br>Copyright � 2005 Leslie Dendy and Mel Boring <br>This text is from an uncorrected proof. <br></p><h2>Dead Big Dawg (A Loon Lake Mystery)</h2><p><b><i>Murder, She Wrote</i></b><b> meets <i>Fargo </i>in the Northwoods of Wisconsin in the nineteenth &#x201c;gripping, atmospheric, and smart&#x201d; (T.

Watching one another, sometimes watching the creatures moving through the towering pines surrounding them . . . just . . . watching.<br> <br>The owl had seen her head move as the bullet slammed into her brain. Death was painless, even as the brilliance of her mind was extinguished.<br> <br>When the old woman had lain still too long, when her eyes no longer met his, the owl sent the alert. Within seconds the forest surrounding Loon Lake erupted with alarms as owls woke their feathered cousins to pass along the warning.<br> <br>Eight-year-old Cody Amundson, fishing in the dark off his grandfather&#x2019;s dock, paused before casting his lure. The explosion of birdcalls caught him by surprise. Turning toward shore, he was scanning the pine boughs over his head when a scream pierced the air. Throwing his spinning rod into the rowboat moored alongside the dock, Cody ran up the stone stairway leading to his grandfather&#x2019;s house. He banged through the porch door and right into the arms of Dr. Paul Osborne.<br> <br>&#x201c;Shhhh. Settle down, Cody. It&#x2019;s okay,&#x201d; said Osborne, grasping the trembling boy firmly by the shoulders. &#x201c;Just a screech owl.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Are you sure, Gramps? That sounds like a real person. Maybe we should call Chief Ferris?&#x201d;<br> <br>During the same five minutes since the birds had started calling, Ray Pradt had paused to look up from where he was dousing a campfire he had built in hopes of charming his date.<br> <br>&#x201c;My God, Ray, what is that racket?&#x201d; asked the young woman, looking up as she opened the screen door to the trailer. A bat swooped and she nearly dropped the bowl of chips and guacamole she was carrying back to the kitchen.<br> <br>Before Ray could answer, a harsh cry echoed through the trees.<br> <br>&#x201c;What on earth? Who the hell was that?&#x201d; The girl was happy to close the door behind her. &#x201c;Boy, is this a fun place.&#x201d;<br> <br>Paraphrasing his neighbor&#x2019;s words to his grandson, Ray assured Paula that a serial killer was not lurking in the dark. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s an owl, not a human,&#x201d; said Ray, following her into his trailer as the embers died in the fire pit behind him. &#x201c;And don&#x2019;t you worry&#x2014;I know how to keep you safe. . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah, right.&#x201d; The girl grinned as she let him wrap his arms around her.<br> <br>Next door, once Cody nodded that he believed his grandfather, Osborne walked the boy back down to the dock to retrieve his fishing rod. &#x201c;Okay, son? Not afraid anymore?&#x201d; Osborne kept a reassuring hand on the boy&#x2019;s shoulder. &#x201c;We don&#x2019;t want your new rod to end up in the lake, so let&#x2019;s put it away in my fish hut where it&#x2019;ll be safe.&#x201d;<br> <br>Cody relaxed as he stepped into the rowboat to retrieve his rod. Any time spent in Grandpa&#x2019;s fish hut was okay with him.<br> <br>Early the next morning before Cody was up, Osborne was enjoying his coffee on the screened-in porch when Ray gave a quick knock on the porch door before walking in, coffee mug in hand. &#x201c;Morning, Doc. Did you hear that scream last night?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Scared the living daylights out of Cody.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;One more little bunny who won&#x2019;t need a hat,&#x201d; said Ray as he filled his mug from the pot Osborne kept plugged in on the porch.<br> <br>&#x201c;That wasn&#x2019;t a rabbit, that was a screech owl.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh . . . Hmm, wonder what the birds saw. They were pretty excited. . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>The men sipped their coffee: Osborne on his porch swing, Ray in his favorite chair, and the sun throwing shadows on the dock as early summer infused the lake world with life.</p><h2>The Spirit of Spinoza: Healing the Mind</h2><p>BENEDICT SPINOZA was a 17th century philosopher and spiritual psychotherapist. This intellectual self-help book provides important insights from Spinoza's system of thought in a format accessible to the general reader, as well as to those already familiar with his philosophy. By applying his method to our personal lives, we may free ourselves from bondage to our lower emotions and habitual behaviors and thus begin to enjoy the "continuous, supreme, and unending happiness" promised by Spinoza. <p> "Those of us who came of age in the twentieth century were taught that we must adopt a crazy-making strategy of compartmentalizing our lives, putting our rational, scientific side into one corner and our psychological/spiritual side in another. The precarious state of our world is evidence enough that this approach to life is a destructive dead end. You are holding an effective alternative in your hand. "The Spirit of Spinoza" is a brilliant treatise that has been field-tested by Professor Neal Grossman in his own life and that of his students over decades. This book is a masterstroke by a master teacher about a master philosopher. It is also delightfully dangerous, for it has the power to shift one's life onto a new axis, where it becomes possible to blend knowledge and wisdom into an experience that can best be described, quite simply, as waking up." - Larry Dossey, MD, author of "One Mind: How Our Individual Mind Is Part of a Greater Consciousness and Why It Matters"</p></p><p><p>"Those of us who came of age in the twentieth century were taught that we must adopt a crazy-making strategy of compartmentalizing our lives, putting our rational, scientific side into one corner and our psychological/spiritual side in another.

At the same time, the uplifting harmonies and sunny lyrics that propelled Karen Carpenter and her brother, Richard, to international fame belied a different sort of tragedy&#x2014;the underconsumption that led to Karen's death at age thirty-two from the effects of an eating disorder.</p><p> In <i>Why Karen Carpenter Matters</i>, Karen Tongson (whose Filipino musician parents named her after the pop icon) interweaves the story of the singer&#x2019;s rise to fame with her own trans-Pacific journey between the Philippines&#x2014;where imitations of American pop styles flourished&#x2014;and Karen Carpenter&#x2019;s home ground of Southern California. Tongson reveals why the Carpenters' chart-topping, seemingly whitewashed musical fantasies of "normal love" can now have profound significance for her&#x2014;as well as for other people of color, LGBT+ communities, and anyone outside the mainstream culture usually associated with Karen Carpenter&#x2019;s legacy.

The "Half Magic" of the title refers to a coin that the children find. Through a comical series of coincidences, they discover that the coin is magic. Well, it's not <i>totally</i> magic--it's only (you guessed it) <i>half</i> magic. That means there's a certain logic to the wishes one must make to generate a desired outcome. Imagine the results emerging from inaccurate efforts: "half" invisible, "half" rescued, "half" everything! <p> <i>Half Magic</i> is never too cute, and with just enough emotion to complement the magic, this book is sure to hold a special place in any child's library.

No, this was a family crisis, some legal complication involving Vatta&#x2019;s commercial empire in which Ky still owned a large block of shares.<br><br>So Grace insisted, as she always had, and Ky obeyed, as she always had, resentfully. And that&#x2014;�her inability to just say no, politely but firmly&#x2014;�infuriated Ky. She was an admiral now. She had commanded fleets, won battles against high odds. And to cave because an old . . . even in thought, she dared not say anything but old woman . . . had said &#x201c;Come&#x201d; was intolerable.

She turned in her seat, looking across at Jen Bentik, her aide. Commander Bentik, since Jen was so very Cascadian, so very committed to that particular and demanding level of correct behavior. Fifteen years older than Ky, and a head taller, she had been Ky&#x2019;s aide for almost a standard year&#x2014;�another problem Ky needed to deal with.<br><br>Jen had been watching her, a line between her perfectly shaped brows indicating concern. &#x201c;Does it look familiar, Admiral?&#x201d;<br><br>Ky nodded. &#x201c;A lot of water, a lot of islands. Very different from Cascadia, for sure.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I still think it would have been more appropriate for you to take Vanguard&#x2019;s shuttle down to the surface,&#x201d; Jen said, changing the topic. In her mind, Ky&#x2019;s status in the Space Defense Force gave her the right to land an SDF shuttle anywhere she pleased.<br><br>&#x201c;It doesn&#x2019;t bother me,&#x201d; Ky said. &#x201c;They see sending up a Spaceforce shuttle as a military honor.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I suppose. I don&#x2019;t mean to be critical of your home planet, �Admiral&#x2014;�&#x201d; Really? Jen had so far been critical about Slotter Key&#x2019;s every detail, as Ky shared them. &#x201c;But it seems to me that they&#x2019;re not quite&#x2014;�&#x201d; Jen paused.<br><br>&#x201c;Up to Cascadian standards?&#x201d; Ky asked. Jen flushed; her lips thinned. Ky sighed inwardly. She had needed an aide: an admiral&#x2019;s life in peacetime was far more complicated than she had imagined, and Jen was efficient, organized, and capable of handling many situations Ky found difficult. But Jen didn&#x2019;t stop there. She assumed her own sober middle age and Cascadian background gave her license to treat Ky like the child of uncouth barbarians when they were alone. &#x201c;I did tell you,&#x201d; Ky said, keeping her voice light and pleasant, &#x201c;Slotter Key&#x2019;s a lot more casual. You will find it difficult, I expect, at least at first.&#x201d;<br><br>Up came Jen&#x2019;s hackles, so easily raised. &#x201c;I will be perfectly polite.&#x201d; In a tone that meant she was still angry.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, of course. You always are.&#x201d; Impossible to explain to someone who had never been outside her own culture that another set of rules might be legitimate. The last visit to Moray had been marred by Jen&#x2019;s complaints that it was not like Cascadia. This was the core reason she&#x2019;d planned to change aides soon. &#x201c;If someone&#x2019;s being rude&#x2014;�rude in Slotter Key terms&#x2014;�I&#x2019;ll make it clear.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;They don&#x2019;t have etiquette books? To warn strangers about the rules?&#x201d; Cascadia handed every arriving passenger a thick book of rules, and no one could leave the ship until they had agreed to abide by them or face a court. Ky had never found another system so obsessed with etiquette.<br><br>&#x201c;We do&#x2014;�did&#x2014;�but they&#x2019;re mostly for children. For adults, it&#x2019;s a matter of mutual negotiation. There&#x2019;s no legal standard. In my religion&#x201d;&#x2014;�the one she didn&#x2019;t follow anymore&#x2014;�&#x201c;it&#x2019;s important not to take offense unless offense is meant.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I will do my best, Admiral,&#x201d; Jen said, as if picking up a burden almost too heavy to carry.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m certain you will,&#x201d; Ky said. &#x201c;You always do.&#x201d; Ky&#x2019;s skullphone pinged. Her flagship&#x2019;s captain, Pordre, reported that a Slotter Key Spaceforce shuttle had arrived at the main space station. &#x201c;Thank you, Captain,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Shouldn&#x2019;t be any time wasted, then.&#x201d; She looked out the viewport, now in a better mood, though whether from her implant&#x2019;s chemicals or Pordre&#x2019;s report she did not know. She could see ships docked at the space station clearly; several Vatta ships clustered together in Vatta&#x2019;s dedicated section. Back to normal, then&#x2014;�another sign of Stella&#x2019;s fitness to run the family business.<br><br>When she&#x2019;d left Slotter Key, she&#x2019;d been a disgraced former cadet, a political embarrassment to be whisked away out of reach of the media as quickly as possible. How na�ve she&#x2019;d been, how easily fooled by a first-�year cadet asking for help, how blind to the political implications. She wouldn&#x2019;t make that mistake again, though she should probably expect someone to bring up that mess. Most wouldn&#x2019;t. Aunt Grace had told her she was billed as a hero returning in triumph. A trickle of humor rose. Maybe it wouldn&#x2019;t be that bad to come home for a few days; it surely couldn&#x2019;t be worse than her departure had been.<br><br>Below the viewport, the familiar shapes of continents and island chains passed in review. Port Major, the oldest city and planetary capital, was obscured by thick clouds, but north of it on Voruksland&#x2019;s east coast, she picked out Grinock Bay, center of an extinct volcano. She&#x2019;d never been there. Corleigh, the island her family had lived on, Port Major on the mainland, and her uncle&#x2019;s country home southwest of Port Major: that was the extent of her onplanet experience.<br><br>She turned from the viewport again; Jen handed her the latest memtip. Ky uploaded it to her implant. The schedule for the rest of the day; the draft of the speech she would give at dinner that evening; the faces and names of notables who would greet her after landing onplanet or be seated at the same table at dinner. For one of them, she needed no memtip: the Commandant of Slotter Key&#x2019;s military academy.<br><br>She could have done without that. The last time she&#x2019;d seen him, he&#x2019;d told her she must resign. Now she was an admiral at only twenty-�nine, and from a political point of view&#x2014;�something she had learned to recognize&#x2014;�she represented one of the Academy&#x2019;s triumphs. It was bound to be awkward.<br><br>&#x201c;Thank you, Jen,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Your usual excellent briefing.&#x201d; Jen nodded.<br><br>The pinnace docked smoothly. Ky stood when the light came on, and the pinnace pilot came into the cabin. &#x201c;Good flight, Morey,&#x201d; she said to him.<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll be back to pick you up anytime, Admiral,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Just let us know.&#x201d;<br><br>That was another thing about this visit. Open-�ended, Aunt Grace had said. It might take longer than planned. No longer than necessary, she told herself. Her life was elsewhere. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll let you know the moment I know,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t plan to take a vacation down there.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You want us to wait until you&#x2019;ve boarded the shuttle?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No need. It&#x2019;s already docked. I&#x2019;ll be fine. Captain Pordre has all my contact codes.&#x201d; All but one, the very secret one she shared only with Rafe Dunbarger.<br><br>Jen Bentik stood aside as Ky walked to the hatch. All lights green. A perfect match, and thus no reason to worry. She worried anyway. The past few years had given her every reason for caution and few for complacency. She still wore her personal armor under her clothes; she still carried a loaded weapon in all circumstances.<br><br>The hatch opened into a standard air lock. Beyond was the ramp down into the station itself, where the Commandant&#x2014;�erect as ever but showing his age now&#x2014;�awaited her. Professionally impassive, of course, the telltale eyelid not drooping today, and his gaze boring into her like an industrial laser. To either side, behind him, rows of media reps were held back by station security.<br><br>&#x201c;Admiral Vatta,&#x201d; he said. Nothing in his tone but courtesy; the sawtooth edge to his voice that had greeted her at their last meeting was undetectable. She had no doubt he could still deploy it. &#x201c;Welcome to Slotter Key. The Rector of Defense and the President both asked me to convey their sincere regrets that they could not meet you here.&#x201d;<br><br>She had wondered if he would call her by her rank&#x2014;�the rank she had assumed of necessity, not through the usual process of regular promotions overseen by a Board. But of course he did in front of the media. The snakelike tendrils of media feeds hovered over them both. People onplanet would be watching it live. It made her skin itch, but she had the experience now to handle it as blandly as he did.<br><br>&#x201c;Thank you, Commandant.&#x201d; He had a last name, but no one ever used it. &#x201c;I am delighted to meet you again.&#x201d;<br><br>His smile held a glimmer of warmth. &#x201c;And I you, Admiral.&#x201d; He glanced aside, and two of the enlisted personnel with him moved past her toward the hatch to fetch her luggage and Jen&#x2019;s&#x2014;�just one regular case each, and their survival suits, packed by her own trusted crew. That last had necessitated a brief tussle with someone on the Spaceforce end, who had only grudgingly agreed that she could bring it if she wanted. The Commandant&#x2019;s aide, she saw, had turned slightly aside, clearly listening to something in his earbug.<br><br>&#x201c;This is my aide, Commander Bentik,&#x201d; Ky said. &#x201c;She is from Cascadia, in the Moscoe Confederation.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Glad to meet you, Commander,&#x201d; the Commandant said. &#x201c;Forgive me that I am not fully acquainted with Cascadian protocol.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It is my honor, sir,&#x201d; Bentik said. &#x201c;I assure you I will not take offense. Cascadian protocol is not an issue here; I must hope that I have mastered that of Slotter Key.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Let there be no strain between us,&#x201d; the Commandant said, the proper Cascadian mode for senior to junior, and turned to Ky. &#x201c;As the shuttle is ready, Admiral, we might defer further courtesies to the shuttle lounge, if that suits you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Of course.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The Rector asked me to tell you that her new arm is in good shape, but she had a minor accident two days ago&#x2014;�nothing to worry about, she insists. Her physicians recommended she not come up, or she would have met you herself.&#x201d;<br><br>Ky&#x2019;s wariness went up a notch&#x2014;�accident? Or attack?&#x2014;�but she kept her face and voice smooth. &#x201c;I was wondering about her arm. We don&#x2019;t comment on her age, but a complete biograft&#x2014;�&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Could be a difficulty, but has not been for her.&#x201d; The Commandant&#x2019;s aide, head still cocked a little in the manner of someone receiving more information, led the way down the ramp to the arrival lounge, and the six-�person security squad closed around them. The media presence melted away as they left the lounge for the first station corridor.</p><h2>Marco made easy: a three-star chef makes it simple</h2><p>Marco Pierre White serves up more than 100 recipes and shows the home cook how to get big flavours from store-cupboard ingredients.The book has sections for starters, shellfish, fish, meat, poultry, desserts, and Marco uses bottles, jars and packets to make divine sauces, syrups and dressings.</p><p><p>Marco Pierre White was born in Yorkshire in 1961.

For centuries the Bhagavad Gita has remained the single most influential philosophical text shaping Indian thought and life. It addresses itself foursquare to the universal limitations each human being is confronted with: ignorance, sorrow and death. The teaching of the Bhagavad Gita opens with the audacious statement that all these are illegitimate problems caused by ignorance about the real nature of the self. Drawing upon the essence of all Upanishads, Gita explains how the self, the atman, is limitless, indestructible, unborn. This knowledge, Brahmavidya, frees one from all sense of limitation. This is the principal teaching of the Bhagavad Gita. Swami Dayananda&#39;s is a classical vedantic interpretation of the Bhagavad Gita. Without getting lost in a rigid verse-by-verse translation, he plunges with great verve and energy into the central theme of the gita, unerringly picking and choosing key verses to highlight its message. A highly respected and very popular teacher of vedanta, Swami Dayananda succeeds marvelously in conveying the profundity of the Bhagavad Gita, unfolding its teaching with a style and clarity which will appeal to every modern mind.</p><p></p><h2>Secrets of the American Museum of Natural History: Weird and Wonderful Facts about America&#x2019;s Natural History Museum</h2><p><b>Take a behind-the scenes look at the world-famous American Museum of Natural History!</b><br><br> It has millions of visitors, some of the most renowned exhibits ever created, and one of the world&#x2019;s largest collection of dinosaur fossils&#x2014;and now kids can enjoy a special glimpse &#x201c;backstage&#x201d; of the amazing American Museum of Natural History.

At the time, the Romanian Ploesti oil fields produced about a third of all Axis oil, and was Germany's single most important fuel source. In the summer of 1943, the USAAF decided to stage a major raid on Ploesti from air bases in Libya. The resulting Operation <i>Tidal Wave</i> raid on 1 August 1943 was one of the costliest to date, losing 53 aircraft, about a third of the starting force. Of the more than 150 bombers that took part in the raid, only 88 B-24s returned to Libya, 55 of which were damaged. On the other hand, of the 17 Medals of Honor awarded to US soldiers and airmen from Pearl Harbor in 1941 to D-Day in 1944, 5 were awarded to pilots of the <i>Tidal Wave</i> mission in recognition of their extraordinary performance. Although undoubtedly bold and heroic, the mission had questionable results. Initial assessments argued that the mission caused 40% of the refinery capacity at Ploesti to be lost but subsequent studies concluded that the damage was quickly repaired and that output had exceeded August levels within a month.</p><p> This new study examines the raid in detail, exploring the reasons why its dubious success came at such a high price. Supported by maps, diagrams, and full-color artwork including battlescenes and bird's-eye-views, this is the full story of the audacious Ploesti raid of 1943.</p></p><p><p>Steven J.

Berg's hallucinatory, post-cataclysmic epic takes place in an unremitting future-past. The bodies mutate and hybridize. They are erotic and artificial, art and adrenaline. Available for the first time in English as a complete collection, the poems of this contemporary Swedish classic contaminate as they become contaminated&#x2014;drawing on and altering source texts that range from <em>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre</em> to string theory. Calling on fables, science, the pastoral, and the body, DARK MATTER aggravates their perception while exhausting poetry down to its nerve: "a faint spasm of cheers before this, the nervous system's last chance to communicate with the dying I." The result: a monstrous zone of linguistic and bodily interpenetration, cell death, and radiant permutations.<br><br>"Extraordinary and urgent, a coded warning smuggled out of dark."&#x2014;China Mi�ville<br><br>"Aase Berg's poetry is discomforting because it lacks boundaries.... When I read her I notice how my consciousness tries to separate, divide up and make sense of her almost hallucinatory images, but they always glide back together. I get nauseated and almost seasick from her texts."&#x2014;�sa Beckman</p><p>Swedish poet Aase Berg began her artistic trajectory as a member of the radical organization, the Surrealist Group of Stockholm. Her first book, <em>Hos r�djur</em> (WITH DEER), was published in Sweden in 1996. Since then she has published <em>M�rk materia</em> (DARK MATTER), Forsla fett (TRANSFER FAT), <em>Uppland</em> (<em>Uppland</em>) and <em>Loss</em> (<em>Loss</em>). Her first book to appear in English, REMAINLAND: SELECTED POEMS, was published by Action Books in 2004. She is considered one of the most influential and unique poets in Sweden, earning her translations into English and various European languages as well.</p><h2>Slay It with Flowers (Flower Shop Mysteries, No. 2)</h2><p><i>Me, Abby Knight, an entrepreneur!

Many of the images are the result of long exposures that show the blur of human movement as a figure lounges at a bar or steps across a room to feed quarters into a juke box. The resulting "ghosts" animate the pictures and give them an otherworldly quality.</p><p>Today, many of these places no longer exist.

He lives in Zaandam.</p>Grade 5 Up&#x2014;These intertwined graphic novels tell the stories of two girls coming of age in Europe during World War II. <i>A Family Secret</i> follows the story of Helena, who survived the war primarily due to her father's decision to collaborate with the Nazis. She recounts her life and those of others, including citizens stranded in the Dutch East Indies at the time. <i>The Search</i> begins in our current era, with Esther arriving in the Netherlands from the U.S. for her grandson's Bar Mitzvah. While there, she catches up with Helena, whom she befriended at age 12 after fleeing Hitler's Germany for the Netherlands.

For some, this welcome event is relatively stress-free. But for those who are inexperienced in dealing with large sums of money, a windfall can be an overwhelming, even losing, situation. What is the difference between those who build on their financial gains and those who end up worse off than before? In this much-needed, one-of-a-kind book, top financial planner Susan Bradley gets to the heart of the matter by examining the emotional complexity of the windfall experience and how to manage it-and your newfound money-successfully. <p>Whatever the sum involved, the impact of one's emotional state on the way money is handled--or mishandled--cannot be underestimated. In addition to the legal intricacies of receiving sudden money, the element of surprise that catches people unprepared also often leaves them there. Here, at last, is a type of "owner's manual" to sudden money that demystifies the process for recipients and their financial planners. Based on her work with countless clients, many of whose stories appear in this book, Bradley has developed a step-by-step program for moving safely through the three phases of building a solid financial foundation:</p> <ul> <li>Preparation and Planning</li> <li>Investing</li> <li>Monitoring, Giving, and Sharing</li> </ul> <p>Giving individual attention to each possible windfall event, Bradley addresses their distinct tax consequences, insurance and estate planning considerations, as well as the crucial emotional component. She also shares advice on how to put together the proper team of advisors, including an attorney and a therapist. When correctly handled, an unexpected windfall can provide expected benefits that will continue far beyond the lifetime of the initial recipient---and turn sudden money into lasting wealth.</p> <p><b>Turn Sudden Money into Lasting Wealth</b></p> <p>Maximize your wealth and minimize your stress and confusion with this unique, indispensable guide to handling a sudden financial windfall. Written by nationally recognized financial planner Susan Bradley, <i>Sudden Money</i> provides a complete program for successfully managing newfound wealth.

Since any such gain is relative, she says, this literally happens millions of times each year as people abruptly find themselves facing the pecuniary impacts of everything from a death or divorce to an insurance settlement or winning lottery ticket. In <i>Sudden Money</i>, she addresses critical considerations in a straightforward, step-by-step manner that should prove useful to anyone on the receiving end of such a fiscal boon. Her core advice: develop realistic long-term plans with help from a knowledgeable advisor who can steer you through technical obstacles and point out particulars that you might otherwise miss. To assist, she discusses relevant details and outlines specific actions in sections focusing on three interconnected aspects of the process: carefully charting overall goals, which should begin with a reflective period after first learning about the bonanza; judiciously selecting investments that will produce desired results; and firmly establishing systems that keep everything on track. There also are individual chapters dealing with the eight most common sources of "sudden money," including inheritance, retirement, and the exercise of stock options. --<i>Howard Rothman</i>SUSAN BRADLEY has been a Certified Financial Planner for nearly twenty years.

But there is a field of psychology that looks at the bright side, that considers seriously these questions: What makes life most worth living? And how can we pursue a good life? That field is called, not surprisingly, positive psychology. <br><br>In <em>Pursuing the Good Life</em>, one of the founders of positive psychology, Christopher Peterson, offers one hundred bite-sized reflections exploring the many sides of this exciting new field. With the humor, warmth, and wisdom that has made him an award-winning teacher, Peterson takes readers on a lively tour of the sunny side of the psychological street. What are the roles played by positive emotions and happiness, by strengths of character, by optimism, and by good relationships with others? How can we pursue the good life in families, workplaces, schools, and sports, no matter who we are or where we live? With titles such as "You May Now Kiss the Bride--And Would You Like Fries With That?" and "How Can You Tell If Someone from France is Happy?" Peterson good-humoredly explores these questions and many others, including such diverse topics as the difference between employment and work, the value of doing the right thing, and why books matter, among other subjects. <br><br>Throughout, Peterson shows that happiness is not simply the result of a fortunate spin of the genetic wheel. There are things that people can learn to do to lead happier lives. <em>Pursuing the Good Life</em> is both an enjoyable read and an invaluable guide to making the good life part of your everyday existence.<br></p><p><p><b>Featured Blog Post by Christopher Peterson (Featured in <i>Psychology Today</i>)</b></p> <p><strong>Days are Long-Life is Short</strong> By Christopher Peterson, Ph.D. Created Dec 28 2009-4:10pm</p><p> I hope that no one thinks that a writer of blog entries about "the good life" (i.e., me) has it all together. Competitive soul that I am, I bet I could trounce most of you who read my entries on formal measures of neuroticism and rumination. As a writer, I try to convey a public persona of being somewhat evolved and somewhat wise. Believe me, it ain't so. As much as anyone and maybe more than most, I get mired down in the minutiae and hassles of everyday life. I fret about the ever-growing number of e-mail messages that inhabit my inbox. I worry that people may not like me, even and especially people I don't like myself. I putter way too much, sometimes spending as much time formatting a scholarly paper as I do researching and writing it. I fill up many of my days doing small things that do not matter. I know it, but sometimes I can't help myself. </p><p>A common inside joke among research psychologists is that we study those topics that we simply do not get. In some cases, this is obvious. Myopic psychologists seem more likely to study vision than their 20-20 colleagues. Out-of-shape psychologists seem more likely to study physical fitness, and unmarried psychologists seem more likely to study marriage. </p><p>Following this line of reasoning, are positive psychologists less than positive? Sometimes yes, sometimes no. I could characterize the major academic players in positive psychology as walking the walk versus talking the talk, but they are my friends and my colleagues, happy or not, and I will respect their privacy. It's probably enough that I have just outed myself as needing further work. Indeed, gossip is not my point, Rather, my point is to discuss an enemy of the good life, one that is my particular demon but also one that may plague others: getting mired down in the unpleasant details and demands of everyday life. Sometimes people are urged to live in the moment. I think this advice needs to be qualified by understanding what the moment entails. To paraphrase Albert Ellis, if the moment in which we live is draped in ought's and should's, it is probably better not to live in it. </p><p>Everyday life of course poses demands, and I am not saying that we should ignore those we do not like. I am simply saying - to myself, if no one else - to keep the bigger picture in mind. Things not worth doing are not worth doing obsessively. There must be an ancient Buddhist aphorism that makes my point profoundly, but I'll just say it bluntly, in plain 21st century Americanese: Don't sweat the small stuff; and most of it is small stuff. Days are long. Life is short. Live it well. </p><br><strong>Christopher Peterson</strong> was Professor of Psychology at the University of Michigan. One of the world's most highly cited research psychologists and a founder of the field of positive psychology, Peterson was best-known for his studies of optimism and character strengths and their relationship to psychological and physical well-being. He was a frequent blogger for <em>Psychology Today</em>, where many of these short essays first appeared.<br></p><h2>The Use of Bodies (Meridian: Crossing Aesthetics)</h2><p><p>Giorgio Agamben's <i>Homo Sacer</i> was one of the seminal works of political philosophy in recent decades. It was also the beginning of a series of interconnected investigations of staggering ambition and scope, investigating the deepest foundations of Western politics and thought. </p> <p><i>The Use of Bodies</i> represents the ninth and final volume in this twenty-year undertaking, breaking considerable new ground while clarifying the stakes and implications of the project as a whole. It comprises three major sections. The first uses Aristotle's discussion of slavery as a starting point for radically rethinking notions of selfhood; the second calls for a complete reworking of Western ontology; and the third explores the enigmatic concept of "form-of-life," which is in many ways the motivating force behind the entire <i>Homo Sacer</i> project. Interwoven between these major sections are shorter reflections on individual thinkers (Debord, Foucault, and Heidegger), while the epilogue pushes toward a new approach to political life that breaks with the destructive deadlocks of Western thought. <i>The Use of Bodies</i> represents a true masterwork by one of our greatest living philosophers. </p></p><p><b>Giorgio Agamben</b> is a contemporary Italian philosopher and political theorist whose works have been translated into numerous languages. His most recent title with Stanford University Press is <i>Stasis</i> (2015)."<i>The Use of Bodies</i> completes its task as set out&#x2015;Agamben draws together lines of inquiry [and] sets the stage for destituent potential as an inspiration for the coming politics....This work is an essential read for any followers of Agamben's work, as well as one of the more accessible works in his Homo Sacer project." (Michael P.A. Murphy <i><i>Reading Religion</i></i>)<br><br>"Among the most important features of Agamben's work, evident in this volume as much as in the whole series, is his attention to theological categories, and his realization that secular political philosophy roots its concepts in them...This is an important book. It can be read by itself, with profit, as a version of the arguments Agamben has been offering for more than three decades." (Paul J. Griffiths <i><i> Horizons: The Journal of the College Theology</i></i>)<br><br>"In <i>The Use of Bodies</i>, Agamben...takes up again the topic of life, giving us perhaps the most complete genealogy of the philosophical concept of life ever to appear. In particular, Agamben wants to think a conception of life that cannot be separated from its form, a life that cannot be rendered bare. Herein, we are finally treated with Agamben's full conception of the form-of-life, long awaited in his work." (A.J. Smith <i><i>Anglican Theological Review</i></i>)</p><h2>Raising Venture Capital for the Serious Entrepreneur</h2><p><p><b>Have the negotiating edge when getting your new business off the ground</b></p> <p>Written by Dermot Berkery, an internationally known venture capitalist with Delta Partners, this complete toolbook thoroughly details how venture capitalists arrange the financing for a company; what they look for in a business plan; how they value a business; and how they structure the terms of an agreement.

More specifically, each represents marked failures among leaders with legal training. When we look closer at one profession from which we often draw our political, business, and organizational leaders&#x2015;the legal profession&#x2015;we find a deep chasm between what law schools teach and what the world expects. Legal education ignores leadership, sending the next generation of legally-minded leaders into a dynamic world dangerously unprepared. </p> <p><i>Dangerous Leaders</i> exposes the risks and results of leaving lawyers unprepared to lead. It provides law schools, law students, and the legal profession with the leadership tools and models to build a better foundation of leadership acumen. Anthony C. Thompson draws from his twenty years of experience in global executive education for Fortune 100 companies and his experience as a law professor to chart a path forward for better leadership instruction within the legal academy. Using vivid, real-life case studies, Thompson explores catastrophic political, business, and legal failures that have occurred precisely because of a lapse in leadership from those with legal training. He maintains that these practices are chronic leadership failures that could have been avoided. In examining these patterns of failures, it becomes apparent that legal education has fundamentally misread its task.</p> <p>Thompson proposes a fundamental rethinking of legal education, based upon intersectional leadership, to prepare lawyers to assume the types of roles that our increasingly fast-paced world requires. Intersectional leadership challenges lawyer leaders to see the world through a different lens and expects a form of inclusion and respect for other perspectives and experiences that will prove critical to maneuvering in a complex environment. <i>Dangerous Leaders</i> imparts invaluable tools and lessons to best equip current and future generations of legal leaders.</p></p><p><b>Anthony C. Thompson</b> is Professor of Clinical Law at New York University Law School, and the founding faculty director of the Center on Race, Inequality, and the Law at NYU. He is the author of <i>Releasing Prisoners, Redeeming Communities</i> (2008)."The legal profession is a noble one with the ability to positively or adversely impact our society. This important book thoroughly dissects the implications of that power and enlightens us about the importance of training lawyers to be honorable public citizens. Professor Thompson's work is a compelling exploration of the role that training lawyers as civic-minded custodians of the rule of law can play in impacting the public good." (<i>Congressman Hakeem Jeffries</i>)<br><br>"With his signature candor and penetrating analysis, Anthony C. Thompson contemplates a sea change in legal education. Thompson rightly demands that law school must prepare lawyers to lead. And his book goes one step further, offering a clear and compelling roadmap for reimagining the training of lawyers as leaders, and for the development of lawyer leaders who are accountable not only to their clients, but to their communities." (Sherrilyn Ifill <i>President and Director-Counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund</i>)<br><br>"In this very important and original book, Anthony C. Thompson offers specific lessons focusing on what should be done differently so that law schools can effectively teach leadership skills. Beautifully written and comprehensively researched, <i>Dangerous Leaders</i> provides readers with excellent case studies as effective teaching and learning tools. This original book should be required reading for lawyers, law students, and legal educators."

Originally published twenty-five years ago and the basis for an award-winning, three-part PBS documentary, this new edition is complete with a new chapter and an Afterword.<br><br>In this immensely readable tour of the highways and byways of American evangelicalism, Balmer visits a revival meeting in Florida, an Indian reservation in the Dakotas, a trade show for Christian booksellers, and a fundamentalist Bible camp in the Adirondacks. Through the eyes of those that Balmer meets on his journeys, we arrive at a more accurate and balanced understanding of an abiding tradition that, as the author argues, is both rich in theological insights and mired in contradictions. <em>Mine Eyes Have Seen the Glory</em> offers readers a genuine insight into the appeal that the evangelical movement holds for thousands of Americans.<br></p><p><br><strong>Randall Balmer </strong>taught as Professor of American Religious History at Columbia University for twenty-seven years before becoming the Dartmouth Professor in the Arts &amp; Sciences at Dartmouth College in 2012. He has published more than a dozen books, including <em>Redeemer: The Life of Jimmy Carter</em> and <em>The</em> <em>Making of Evangelicalism: From Revivalism to Politics and Beyond</em>.<br><br><em>Review from the previous edition:</em><br><p></p><br>"For more than two decades, historians of religion like Randall Balmer, Joel A. Carpenter, and Mark A. Noll had been exploring these dimensions of American Christianity. Balmer's now classic <em>Mine Eyes Have Seen the Glory: A Journey into the Evangelical Subculture in America</em> (1989), which explored a variety of evangelical movements and communities in a way that both historicized and personalized each, has been especially influential, reaching far beyond the rather narrow audience of American scholars of religion." --<em>The Chronicle of Higher Education</em> <br><p></p><br>"A professor of American religious history at Barnard and Columbia, Balmer wrote this book because he had a 'suspicion that many Americans, and certainly the media, really did not have much of a clue about who evangelicals were, what they believed, or what motivated their forays into the political arena.' Fifteen years after the book was published, and with the gap between evangelicals and other Americans still yawning, the book offers a tour of evangelical enclaves throughout the country."--<em>The Washington Post</em><p></p><br>"Randall Balmer takes readers through evangelical America, and it's a surprisingly lively and light ride. Balmer isn't a preacher, but a fine reporter, curious and respectful about the vitality and diversity of evangelicalism."--<em>The New York Daily News</em><p></p><br>"A sensitive, informed, often moving account of lifestyles and belief systems that coexist with--but are usually set apart from--secular mainstream America.... Provides a carefully crafted portrait of religious diversity that is both generous and critical but never patronizing.... We can all read this book with profit."--<em>Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography</em><p></p><br>"Fascinating.... This is a wonderful book.... Fair, insightful and respectful.... Balmer understands what he sees, but has enough distance from his subject to be analytical. Outsiders will learn much from his carefully nuanced insights; and insiders will frequently have to nod their heads in agreement: this man knows what he is talking about."--<em>Church History</em><p></p><br>"This compelling account makes Randall Balmer the William Least Heat Moon of American evangelicalism. Just as <em>Blue Highways</em> opened up an ordinary America beyond the bright city lights, so Balmer goes beyond media stars like Jerry Falwell, Billy Graham, and Jimmy Swaggart to illuminate the local realities of evangelical life. The worlds of Protestant conservatives are complex--filled overfull with the eccentric and the authentic, locked tightly in the grip of kitsch as well as the grip of grace. In describing that world from Oregon to New Hampshire, Des Moines to Phoenix, Mississippi to North Dakota--Balmer doesn't miss a nuance or a beat."--Mark A. Noll, <em>Wheaton College</em><p></p><br>"<em>Mine Eyes Have Seen the Glory</em> is a book about the sawdust trail that glitters like angel dust. It is witty, lively and richly informative--written with real style and sophistication, and a delight to read."--Frederick Buechner<p></p><br>"Easily the best participant-observer study of the evangelical landscape in contemporary America. He combines the insight of the trained historian with the deft instincts of the birthright insider. The product is at once a critical, painfully funny, warmly sympathetic exploration of the multiple subcultures of a sprawling religious tradition that is all too easily stereotyped--and dismissed--as monolithic fundamentalism."--Grant Wacker, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill<p></p><br>"American evangelicalism is as diverse as the nation's landscape. Balmer's book is an extraordinary religious travelogue through that complicated subculture....After reading [his] book, popular stereotypes of 'evangelicals' and 'fundamentalists' will never again be quite so clearly focused."--David E. Harrell, Jr., University of Alabama, Birmingham<p></p><br>"A powerful examination of those ingredients that constitute the very essence of the phenomenon called American evangelicism. <em>Mine Eyes Have Seen the Glory</em> is absolutely essential for anyone who wishes to understand the religious landscape of contemporary America."--Lewis V.

The collisions produce a plasma of quarks and gluons in a sizable volume, with a density greater than that in a neutron star and with a temperature 100 000 times that in the Sun's core. These conditions match those a few microseconds after the big bang beginning of the universe. In our normal low-energy world, quarks and gluons are always locked up inside the confines of particles such as protons and neutrons. However, in the high-energy collisions within ALICE, they undergo deconfinement to produce the plasma, which is a unique state of matter that acts like an ideal fluid with no viscosity.

In the early 1300s instabilities threatened to undermine Spain&#39;s basic social, economic, political, and cultural structures. This text focuses on the crises of Spain in the late middle ages, ranging from plague and famine to violence and civil war. It considers the early transformations that underpinned the country&#39;s later successes and describes resolutions to the country&#39;s hardships brought about by the reforms of the Catholic Monarchs, Ferdinand and Isabella, in the late 1470s. The book examines the administrative changes and cultural revival that readied Spain for the opportunities and challenges of the oncoming early modern Age of Discovery.<b>Teofilo F.

Many developers are turning to OpenSSL, an open source version of SSL/TLS, which is the most widely used protocol for secure network communications.The OpenSSL library is seeing widespread adoption for web sites that require cryptographic functions to protect a broad range of sensitive information, such as credit card numbers and other financial transactions. The library is the only free, full-featured SSL implementation for C and C++, and it can be used programmatically or from the command line to secure most TCP-based network protocols.<i>Network Security with OpenSSL</i> enables developers to use this protocol much more effectively. Traditionally, getting something simple done in OpenSSL could easily take weeks. This concise book gives you the guidance you need to avoid pitfalls, while allowing you to take advantage of the library?s advanced features. And, instead of bogging you down in the technical details of how SSL works under the hood, this book provides only the information that is necessary to use OpenSSL safely and effectively. In step-by-step fashion, the book details the challenges in securing network communications, and shows you how to use OpenSSL tools to best meet those challenges.As a system or network administrator, you will benefit from the thorough treatment of the OpenSSL command-line interface, as well as from step-by-step directions for obtaining certificates and setting up your own certification authority. As a developer, you will further benefit from the in-depth discussions and examples of how to use OpenSSL in your own programs. Although OpenSSL is written in C, information on how to use OpenSSL with Perl, Python and PHP is also included.OpenSSL may well answer your need to protect sensitive data. If that?s the case, <i>Network Security with OpenSSL</i> is the only guide available on the subject.</p></p><p><p>John Viega, Founder and Chief Scientist of Secure Software (www.securesoftware.com), is a well-known security expert, and coauthor of Building Secure Software (Addison-Wesley) and Network Security with OpenSSL (O'Reilly).

With just 350 passages (more than half of them consisting of Latin inscriptions, from all over Rome&#x2019;s empire), Harvey manages to give his readers a real sense of Roman private values and behaviors. His translations of the original texts are superb&#x2014;both accurate and elegant. And he contextualizes his chosen passages with a series of remarkably economical but solidly reliable introductions. In a word, <b>Harvey&#x2019;s sourcebook strikes me as the best now available for a single-semester undergraduate course</b>."<br> &#x2014;T.

The texts are all translated into clear, accurate English. They are also thoroughly contextualized, both in categories as well as individually. This insistence on the historicity of the sources sets the book apart from the norm. The book also benefits from Harvey&#x2019;s extensive, almost encyclopedic, knowledge of inscriptions, which are used as important sources along with the literary excerpts.

Each book poses a question that historians debate--<em>How democratic was the U.S. Constitution?</em> or <em>Why did</em> <em>civil war erupt in the United States in 1861?</em>--and provides abundant primary sources so that students can make their own efforts at interpreting the evidence. They can then use that analysis to construct answers to the big question that frames the debate and argue in support of their position.<br><br><em>The Causes of the Civil War</em> poses this big question: <em>Why did civil war erupt in the United States in 1861?</em><br></p><p><br><strong>Joel M.

Every drop of seawater takes part in tidal motion, driven by the gravitational pull of the moon and sun. At the coast, we see the tide as a twice-daily rise and fall of sea level that moves the edge of the sea up and down a beach or cliff-face. In some places, the tide is small but at others it can rise in a few hours by the height of a three storey building; it then has to be treated with great respect by those who live and work by the sea. <br><br>In this <em>Very Short Introduction</em> David George Bowers and Emyr Martyn Roberts explore what we know about the tides. Blending clear explanations of well known tidal phenomena with recent insights in the deep ocean and coastal seas, Bowers and Roberts use examples from around the world, to tell the story of the tide, considering its nature and causes, its observation and prediction, and unusual tides and their relevance. They explore why tides have attracted the attention of some of the world's greatest scientists, from the initial challenge of explaining why there are two tides a day when the moon and sun pass overhead just once; a problem that was solved by Isaac Newton. In the 19th century, scientists unravelled the rhythms of the tide; good tidal predictions in the form of tide tables were then possible. The predictions were made on beautiful tide predicting machines constructed of brass and mahogany, some of which can still be seen in maritime museums. In the 20th century, the importance of tides as mixers of sea water became evident. As Bowers and Roberts explore, tidal mixing of the ocean is essential for maintaining its deep circulation, a key part of the climate-control system of our planet. In inshore waters, tidal mixing enhances biological productivity, influences sea temperature and turbidity and creates dramatic features such as maelstroms and tidal bores. In the 21st century, space probes are examining the effects of tidal processes on the moons of Jupiter and Saturn and the possibility of tidally-heated liquid oceans with their own ecosystems. Looking to the cutting edge of tidal research, Bowers and Roberts also consider how we can study the role of the tide in the geological and biological evolution of our own planet with innovative computer models.<br>ABOUT THE SERIES: The <em>Very Short Introductions</em> series from Oxford University Press contains hundreds of titles in almost every subject area.

In the &#34;toolkit,&#34; students are reminded of key terms and concepts and key relationships that are needed to solve the types of problems in a chapter. This is followed by a breakdown of the types of problems students will encounter in the end of chapter problems for a particular chapter: they learn the key strategies to solve each type, variations on a problem type that they may encounter, and a worked example modeled after the Genetic Analysis feature of the main textbook. The solutions also reflect the Evaluate, Deduce, and Solve strategy of the Genetic Analysis feature. As not all end-of-chapter problems will require all three steps, the solution is broken down to reflect only the solution strategies required to find the answer. This approach helps students assess the level of problems and the solution strategies that they struggle with the most.

At the age of nine, tragedy strikes the family when his father was murdered. In the aftermath, tribe members abandon his family and even steal their domestic animals. To survive, Temujin's mother takes him and his younger brother to pick wild pears and they fish by drilling holes on the ice-frozen river. This hard life strengthens the bonds of love within the family, enabling Temujin to become a bright and courageous child. <br><br>Confronting the disintegrated tribes and continuous wars on the Mongolian grassland, Temujin was determined to bring peace and a comfortable place for his family to live.

Well before the Montgomery bus boycott, mothers led their children into segregated amusement parks, teenagers congregated at forbidden swimming pools, and church groups picnicked at white-only parks. But too often white mobs attacked those who dared to transgress racial norms. In <i>Race, Riots, and Roller Coasters</i>, Victoria W. Wolcott tells the story of this battle for access to leisure space in cities all over the United States.</p><p>Contradicting the nostalgic image of urban leisure venues as democratic spaces, Wolcott reveals that racial segregation was crucial to their appeal. Parks, pools, and playgrounds offered city dwellers room to exercise, relax, and escape urban cares. These gathering spots also gave young people the opportunity to mingle, flirt, and dance. As cities grew more diverse, these social forms of fun prompted white insistence on racially exclusive recreation. Wolcott shows how black activists and ordinary people fought such infringements on their right to access public leisure. In the face of violence and intimidation, they swam at white-only beaches, boycotted discriminatory roller rinks, and picketed Jim Crow amusement parks. When African Americans demanded inclusive public recreational facilities, white consumers abandoned those places. Many parks closed or privatized within a decade of desegregation. Wolcott's book tracks the decline of the urban amusement park and the simultaneous rise of the suburban theme park, reframing these shifts within the civil rights context.</p><p>Filled with detailed accounts and powerful insights, <i>Race, Riots, and Roller Coasters</i> brings to light overlooked aspects of conflicts over public accommodations. This eloquent history demonstrates the significance of leisure in American race relations.</p></p><p>Victoria W. Wolcott is Professor of History at the University at Buffalo, SUNY, and the author of Remaking Respectability: African-American Women in Interwar Detroit.<p>Introduction</p><blockquote>When you suddenly find your tongue twisted and your speech stammering as you seek to explain to your six-year-old daughter why she can't go to the public amusement park that has just been advertised on television, and see tears welling up in her eyes when she is told that Funtown is closed to colored children . . . then you will understand why we find it difficult to wait.<br>&#x2014;Martin Luther King, Jr., "Letter from Birmingham Jail" (1963)<p></p><p>I do not know many Negroes who are eager to be "accepted" by white people, still less to be loved by them; they, the blacks, simply don't wish to be beaten over the head by the whites every instant of our brief passage on this planet.<br>&#x2014;James Baldwin, <i>The Fire Next Time</i></p></blockquote>When Martin Luther King, Jr.'s daughter Yolanda Denise asked her father why she could not go to Funtown, she touched on a painful reality that has been largely forgotten. Across the country, North and South, young African Americans discovered that time-honored discriminatory practices limited their access to amusement parks and other recreational facilities. And when they did approach these spaces they often confronted the white violence invoked by James Baldwin. Blacks wanted freedom and mobility without being "beaten over the head." They sought to live their lives fully as citizens and consumers without the constraints of segregation. Like King, they wished to protect their children from the reality of racism. Blacks desired not to be "loved" by whites but to coexist with them&#x2014;and to use the swimming pools, roller-skating rinks, and Funtowns that made urban life in mid-twentieth-century America pleasurable.<p></p><p>The segregated recreation that the King family encountered in Atlanta was present throughout the country. The problem of segregated amusements was national in scope and the solution required a broad-based movement. African Americans in the twentieth century engaged in just such a movement, not simply for integration but for the occupation of public space in American cities. Among the most coveted urban spaces were those that encouraged young men and women to put aside their daily cares, flirt, and play. This potential for romance, and the association of African Americans with dirt and disorder, led to whites' insistence that recreational spaces be racially homogenous. Owners and managers of amusements constantly reassured their white customers that their facilities were clean and safe places to let loose and mix with the opposite sex. The result was an elaborate system of racial segregation in urban recreation. How African Americans challenged this segregation is the subject of this book.</p><p>Historians have developed a deep understanding of racial discrimination in housing and labor in mid-twentieth-century cities, yet their understanding of recreation remains shallow. Recreational facilities are public accommodations and can appear marginal compared to economic and political structures. Historians who have challenged the "master narrative" of civil rights by expanding their analyses both chronologically and geographically have promoted the primacy of economic and housing issues in the past decade and moved away from the examination of public accommodations. The long civil rights movement now incorporates the class struggles of the Great Depression and the welfare rights and black power movements of the 1970s. Rather than focusing on the conflict between the southern civil rights movement and whites' massive resistance to integration, historians have reached north and west to examine myriad local struggles for racial equality and freedom. Central to these examinations are economic policies, particularly in works that incorporate labor struggles during the Great Depression and World War II. And the civil rights movement's expansion north and west has shifted our attention to discriminatory housing patterns that segregated American cities.</p><p>For historians who focus on political economy, the struggle to open public accommodations is sometimes viewed as legalistic. Some see efforts to desegregate public accommodations as part of an "integrationist framework" that ignores black nationalism and views the 1964 Civil Rights Act as the culmination of the movement. Integration, it has been argued, also undermined black economic power and self-determination. Focusing on public accommodations can also reify the dichotomy of the "innocent" North, where Jim Crow supposedly did not exist, versus the "evil" South, with its system of legal apartheid. Historians of the long civil rights movement reject this dichotomy and demonstrate the culpability of the state in creating and reinforcing patterns of segregation throughout the country. These historians also reject the notion that black power activists' commitment to self-defense undermined nonviolence and interracialism, thus leading to the movement's decline. Instead, they take seriously the broader goals of black nationalism and refuse to elevate nonviolent activists to near saintly positions in the American imagination.</p><p>With these important correctives in mind, is it possible to revisit the struggle to open public accommodations while escaping the "integrationist framework"? I believe it is, but historians must recognize that our view of what constituted civil rights activism cannot be a zero-sum game. Desegregating public accommodations was a goal powerfully desired by African Americans throughout the country. Just because white liberals, who saw integration as the primary goal of racial equality, also embraced this objective does not diminish its centrality in the black freedom movement. Liberal interracialism coexisted with radical interracialism promoted by nonviolent pacifists and ordinary black citizens who demanded immediate change, not the gradual process of moral persuasion promoted by racial liberals. These movements are related but should not be conflated. Therefore, writing public accommodations out of the civil rights narrative, or downplaying it, is a mistake. Rather, we need to rethink the struggle for public accommodations with the insights of the long civil rights movement historiography in mind.</p><p>One way to broaden our understanding of desegregation is by conceiving of it as part of a broader struggle for control of and access to urban space. The segregation of public accommodations denied African Americans their right to occupy the same spaces as whites. They could not act as consumers on an equal basis, and they could not fully inhabit the cities and towns in which they lived. African Americans' demand for the right to use recreation was not simply about integration and interracial friendship but about power and possession. For this reason the struggle for recreational space was not only the purview of southern nonviolent activists but a national movement that included teenagers, mothers, and ordinary consumers who demanded equal access without having to face racial epithets and daily violence. African Americans wanted to participate in all the recreation cities had to offer, and they wished to protect their children from white violence. Violence perpetrated by whites, however, has not been widely recognized as a major factor in maintaining segregation. Popular memories of mid-twentieth-century urban amusements are replete with nostalgia and rarely contain references to segregation. This erasure of white violence has led many to blame the decline of urban recreation on "deviant" behavior by African Americans in newly desegregated amusements.</p><p>The struggle to desegregate public accommodations in the face of white terror did not begin with Rosa Parks's defiant stance in 1954. Even when identifying only activists who employed nonviolent passive resistance to challenge Jim Crow, one has to look at least a decade before the Montgomery bus boycott. The pioneering members of the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) carried out a major campaign against Chicago's segregated White City Roller Rink in 1942 and fine-tuned organizing strategies that would prove enormously effective a decade later. And prior to the war years many ordinary African American citizens challenged segregated recreation nationwide, swimming at whites only beaches, boycotting segregated roller rinks, and picketing Jim Crow amusement parks. For most the goal was desegregation, obtaining the right to occupy recreational space, rather than integration, fully sharing facilities with white neighbors. But motivations for engaging in the struggle over recreation varied. Liberal and radical white supporters of desegregation campaigns&#x2014;for example, the white members of CORE who put their bodies on the line to fight for racial equality&#x2014;were more likely to view full integration and interracialism as the goal. Middle-class African Americans often sought the respectability that came with full participation in consumerism. Working-class African Americans frequently conceived of the occupation of public space as a form of community control and a means to protect family members. Together these actors challenged the racial logic that associated white spaces with safety and security.</p><p>Moreover, the struggle for desegregated public accommodations was never fully distinct from the struggle for equal access to housing and employment. A local swimming pool or playground was an extension of a neighborhood, and as the racial composition of neighborhoods changed, urban dwellers contested these spaces. Whites who defended their "rights" to all-white workplaces and communities perhaps best understood this connection. Indeed, there is a relationship between what I term "recreation riots," racial conflicts in spaces of leisure, with housing riots in mid-twentieth-century American cities. Historians have documented hundreds of small-scale and large-scale housing riots in the 1940s and 1950s. In most cases, these were precipitated by an African American family's attempt to move into a white neighborhood, only to be met with angry residents who burned crosses, damaged property, and generally terrorized the newcomers. In the summer of 1951 one such riot in Cicero, an all-white suburb of Chicago, gained national attention as thousands of whites firebombed and gutted an apartment building after a middle-class black family moved in. Many miles away that same summer a white guard at Palisades Park, a New Jersey amusement park across the Hudson River from Manhattan, invoked this housing riot to justify his own threat of racial violence. When a black activist, Ulysses Smith, attempted to enter the Palisades Park pool the guard stopped him and asked whether "he wanted to create an incident such as had occurred in Cicero." In this case the Palisades guard used Cicero as a weapon to intimidate black activists and consumers. Violent attempts to forestall housing integration legitimated violent attempts to forestall recreational integration.</p><p>Two years before Smith approached the Palisades pool, New Jersey passed the Freeman Civil Rights Act in response to pressure from activists. The act specifically named swimming pools as a public accommodation where discrimination was prohibited. But the legal niceties of civil rights legislation had minimal meaning in such confrontations. Instead, it was Smith's willingness to brave the guards and white crowds at the pool that defined the limits and possibilities of desegregation. The law was a major player in the struggle over recreational segregation, but it did not have the power to enforce equal access to public accommodations. Most northern and border states had both civil rights laws and segregated recreational facilities. Some southern communities had no segregation laws mandating separate facilities, and yet blacks had little access to recreation. This complex story undercuts the simplistic binary of southern de jure segregation versus northern de facto segregation. Despite this, many scholars and observers would agree with Randall Kennedy that "Racial discrimination in places of public accommodation was, for the most part, a peculiar feature of southern folkways." This "southern exceptionalism" pervades discussions of public accommodations and reinforces the myth of an innocent North and guilt-ridden South. But even a cursory review of the evidence demonstrates that recreational segregation and the struggle to dismantle it were both national in scope.</p><p>Arguing for a national civil rights narrative and the end to southern exceptionalism does not erase the specific legal and social histories of different localities. White resistance to recreational integration in Birmingham, Alabama, was more profound and violent than white resistance to recreational integration in Buffalo, New York. And specific forms of recreation were more popular in some regions than others. Traditional urban amusement parks, for example, were largely phenomena of the Northeast and Midwest where entrepreneurs built them at the end of trolley lines. Throughout this book I have emphasized the lesser-known stories of northern segregation that have been widely neglected by scholars. To borrow from Jeanne Theoharis, in these cities recreational segregation was "hidden in plain sight." The presence of northern segregation challenges notions of northern innocence and helps us understand the civil rights movement as circulatory, rather than traveling from south to north. Individual activists who led campaigns to open amusement parks in Cleveland and New Jersey during the 1940s and 1950s trained nonviolent activists who challenged segregated accommodations in the South in the early 1960s. In addition, throughout the country ordinary African Americans insisted on their right to access amusements during the postwar period. Some became part of a political movement by filing lawsuits with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) or joining CORE, but many others engaged in daily forms of civil disobedience that were disconnected from civil rights leadership. When teenagers carried out this disobedience most commentators viewed their occupation of public space as juvenile delinquency or crime rather than a demand for racial equality. Throughout this book my focus will be on uncovering these stories on the local level rather than making broad regional generalities. Together these local stories document a national narrative of a mass movement to open recreational facilities to all Americans.</p><p>Although the struggle against segregation was national in scope, African Americans who sought to highlight the pervasiveness of Jim Crow and shame whites who supported it often used the language of regionalism as a tool. For example, in 1921 the African American newspaper <i>Chicago Defender</i> editorialized against beach segregation with the statement "This is not the South, and we refuse to be 'jim-crowed.'" In claiming that Chicago was "not the South" Chicago blacks were demanding that white northerners live up to their reputation as moderate on racial issues. Thus the myth of southern exceptionalism was not an invention of white supremacists alone but mobilized and perpetuated by African Americans to gain racial equality in the North and West. Some whites also used this rhetoric of regionalism to justify segregation. The owners of Coney Island Amusement Park in Cincinnati, for example, argued that their pa...</p></p><h2>A History of New York (Penguin Classics)</h2><p>In 1809, New Yorkers were buzzing about a series of classified ads concerning the whereabouts of Dutch historian Diedrich Knickerbocker.

However, he unexpectedly became the favored heir to his father after a failed rebellion by his older brothers in 1173. He became king in 1199, though his reign was tumultuous and short. After a brief peace with Phillip II of France, war broke out again in 1202 and King John lost most of his holdings on the continent. This, coupled with unpopular fiscal policies and treatment of nobles back home, led to conflict upon his return from battle. Buffeted from all sides, King John was pushed in 1215 to sign along with his barons the Magna Carta, a precursor to constitutional governance. But both sides failed to uphold the agreements terms and conflict quickly resumed, leading to John&#x2019;s untimely death a year later to dysentery.<br><br>Pitched at newcomers to the subject, <i>1215 and All That</i> will explain how King John&#x2019;s rule and, in particular, his signing of the Magna Carta changed England&#x2014;and the English&#x2014;forever, introducing readers to the early days of medieval England.

Morgan radically reshapes and recharges science fiction yet again, with a new and unforgettable hero in Carl Marsalis: hybrid, hired gun, and a man without a country . . . or a planet. </b><br><br> Marsalis is one of a new breed. Literally. Genetically engineered by the U.S. government to embody the naked aggression and primal survival skills that centuries of civilization have erased from humankind, Thirteens were intended to be the ultimate military fighting force. The project was scuttled, however, when a fearful public branded the supersoldiers dangerous mutants, dooming the Thirteens to forced exile on Earth&#x2019;s distant, desolate Mars colony. But Marsalis found a way to slip back&#x2013;and into a lucrative living as a bounty hunter and hit man before a police sting landed him in prison&#x2013;a fate worse than Mars, and much more dangerous. <br><br> Luckily, his &#x201c;enhanced&#x201d; life also seems to be a charmed one. A new chance at freedom beckons, courtesy of the government. All Marsalis has to do is use his superior skills to bring in another fugitive. But this one is no common criminal. He&#x2019;s another Thirteen&#x2013;one who&#x2019;s already shanghaied a space shuttle, butchered its crew, and left a trail of bodies in his wake on a bloody cross-country spree. And like his pursuer, he was bred to fight to the death. Still, there&#x2019;s no question Marsalis will take the job. Though it will draw him deep into violence, treachery, corruption, and painful confrontation with himself, anything is better than remaining a prisoner. The real question is: can he remain sane&#x2013;and alive&#x2013;long enough to succeed?</p><p><b>Richard K.

It wasn&#x2019;t a bad cover in itself, and it probably would have stood standard scrutiny. Security checks in the prep camps were notoriously lax; the truth was that they didn&#x2019;t much care who you&#x2019;d been before you signed up. But there were still a few obvious signs you could look for if you knew how, and Carl, with a methodical intensity that was starting to resemble desperation, had been looking for weeks. He knew that Gray was up on the altiplano somewhere, because the trail led there from Bogot�, and because where else, ultimately, was a variant thirteen going to run. He knew this, and he knew it was just a matter of time before the traces showed up and someone called it in. But he also knew, with induction programs everywhere skimping and speeding up to meet increasing demand, that time was on the other man&#x2019;s side. Something had to give, and soon, or Gray was going to be gone and Carl wasn&#x2019;t going to get his bounty.<br><br>So when the break came, the tiny morsel of data finally fed back from the web of contacts he&#x2019;d been plying all those weeks, it was hard not to jump. Hard not to dump his painstakingly constructed cover, fire up his Agency credit and badge, and hire the fastest set of all-terrain wheels available in Copacabana. Hard not to tear across the border at Agency speed, raising road dust and rumors all the way to the camp, where Gray, of course, if he had any kind of local support, would be long gone.<br><br>Carl didn&#x2019;t jump.<br><br>Instead, he called in a couple of local favors and managed to blag a ride across the border with a military liaison unit&#x2014;some superannuated patrol carrier with a Colony corporation&#x2019;s logo sun-bleached to fading on the armored sides. The troops were Peruvian regulars, drafted in from dirt-poor families in the coastal provinces and then seconded to corporate security duties. They&#x2019;d be pulling down little more than standard conscript pay for that, but the interior of the carrier was relatively plush by military standards and it seemed to have air-con. And anyway, they were tough and young, a sort of young you didn&#x2019;t see so much in the Western world anymore, innocently pleased with their hard-drilled physical competence and cheap khaki prestige. They all had wide grins for him, and bad teeth, and none was older than twenty. Carl figured the good cheer for ignorance. It was a safe bet these kids didn&#x2019;t know the subcontract rate their high command was extracting from its corporate clients for their services.<br><br>Sealed inside the jolting, sweat-smelling belly of the vehicle, brooding on his chances against Gray, Carl would really have preferred to stay silent altogether. He didn&#x2019;t like to talk, never had. Felt in fact that it was a much-overrated pastime. But there was a limit to how taciturn you could be when you were getting a free ride. So he mustered some lightweight chat about next week&#x2019;s Argentina&#x2013;Brazil play-off and threw as little of it into the conversational mix as he thought he could get away with. Some comments about Patricia Mocatta, and the advisability of female captains for teams that were still predominantly male. Player name checks. Tactical comparisons. It all seemed to go down fine.<br><br>&#x201c;�Eres Marciano?&#x201d; one of them asked him, finally, inevitably.<br><br>He shook his head. In fact, he had been a Martian once, but it was a long, complicated story he didn&#x2019;t feel like telling.<br><br>&#x201c;Soy contable,&#x201d; he told them, because that was sometimes what he felt like. &#x201c;Contable de biotecnologia.&#x201d;<br><br>They all grinned. He wasn&#x2019;t sure if it was because they didn&#x2019;t think he looked like a biotech accountant, or because they just didn&#x2019;t believe him. Either way they didn&#x2019;t push the point. They were used to men with stories that didn&#x2019;t match their faces.<br><br>&#x201c;Habla bien el espa�ol,&#x201d; someone complimented him.<br><br>His Spanish was good, though for the last two weeks it was Quechua he&#x2019;d been speaking mostly, Mars-accented but still tight up against the Peruvian original that had spawned it. It was what the bulk of the altiplano dwellers used, and they in turn made up most of the grunt labor force in the prep camps, just as they still did on Mars. Notwithstanding which fact, the language of enforcement up here was still Spanish. Aside from a smattering of web-gleaned Amanglic, these guys from the coast spoke nothing else. Not an ideal state of affairs from the corporate point of view, but the Lima government had been adamant when the COLIN contracts were signed. Handing over control to the gringo corporations was one thing, had oligarchy-endorsed historical precedent on its side in fact. But allowing the altiplano dwellers to shake themselves culturally loose from the grip of coastal rule, well, that would be simply unacceptable. There was just too much bad history in the balance. The original Incas six hundred years ago and their stubborn thirty-year refusal to behave as a conquered people should, the bloody reprise by T�pac Amaru in 1780, the Sendero Luminoso Maoists a bare century back, and more recently still the upheavals of the familias andinas. The lessons had been learned, the word went out. Never again. Spanish-speaking uniforms and bureaucrats drove home the point.<br><br>The patrol carrier pulled up with a jerk, and the rear door hinged weightily outward. Harsh, high-altitude sunlight spilled in, and with it came the sound and smell of the camp. Now he heard Quechua, the familiar un-Spanish cadences of it, shouted back and forth above the noise of machinery in motion. An imported robot voice trampled it down, blared vehicle reversing, vehicle reversing in Amanglic. There was music from somewhere, huayno vocals remixed to a bloodbeat dance rhythm. Pervasive under the scent of engine oil and plastics, the dark meat odor of someone grilling antecuchos over a charcoal fire. Carl thought he could make out the sound of rotors lifting somewhere in the distance.<br><br>The soldiers boiled out, dragging packs and weapons after. Carl let them go, stepped down last and looked around, using their boisterous crowding as cover. The carrier had stopped on an evercrete apron opposite a couple of dusty, parked coaches with destination boards for Cuzco and Arequipa. There was a girdered shell of a terminal building, and behind it Garrod Horkan 9 camp stretched away up the hill, all single-story prefab shacks and sterile rectilinear street plan. Corporate flags fluttered whitely on poles every few blocks, an entwined g and h ringed by stars. Through the unglassed windows of the terminal, Carl spotted figures wearing coveralls with the same logo emblazoned front and back.<br><br>Fucking company towns.<br><br>He dumped his pack in a locker block inside the terminal, asked directions of a coveralled cleaner, and stepped back out into the sun on the upward-sloping street. Down the hill, Lake Titicaca glimmered painfully bright and blue. He slipped on the Cebe smart lenses, settled his battered leather Peruvian Stetson on his head, and started up the slope, tracking the music. The masking was more local cover than necessity&#x2014;his skin was dark and leathered enough not to worry about the sun, but the lenses and hat would also partially obscure his features. Black faces weren&#x2019;t that common in the altiplano camps, and unlikely though it was, Gray might have someone watching the terminal. The less Carl stood out, the better.<br><br>A couple of blocks up the street, he found what he was looking for. A prefab twice the size of the units around it, leaking the bloodbeat and huayno remix through shuttered windows and a double door wedged back. The walls were stickered with peeling publicity for local bands, and the open door space was bracketed by two loopview panels showing some Lima ad agency&#x2019;s idea of Caribbean nightlife. White sand beach and palm trees by night, party lights strung. Bikini-clad criolla girls gripped beer bottles knowingly and pumped their hips to an unheard rhythm alongside similarly European-looking consorts. Outside of the band&#x2014;jet-muscled and cavorting gaily in the background, well away from the women&#x2014;no one had skin any darker than a glass of blended Scotch and water.<br><br>Carl shook his head bemusedly and went inside.<br><br>The bloodbeat was louder once he got in, but not unbearable. The roof tented at second-story height, nothing but space between the plastic rafters, and the music got sucked up there. At a corner table, three men and a woman were playing a card game that required calls, apparently without any trouble tracking one another&#x2019;s voices. Conversation at other tables was a constant murmur you could hear. Sunlight fell in through the doorway and shutters. It made hard bars and blocks on the floor but didn&#x2019;t reach far, and if you looked there directly then looked away, the rest of the room seemed dimly lit by comparison.<br><br>At the far end of the room, a boomerang-angled bar made from riveted tin sections held up half a dozen drinkers. It was set far enough back from the windows that the beer coolers on the wall behind glowed softly in the gloom. There was a door set in the wall and propped open on an equally dimly lit kitchen space, apparently empty and not in use. The only visible staff took the form of a dumpy indigena waitress slouching about between the tables, collecting bottles and glasses on a tray. Carl watched her intently for a moment, then followed her as she headed back toward the bar.<br><br>He caught up with her just as she put down her tray on the bartop.<br><br>&#x201c;Bottle of Red Stripe,&#x201d; he said, in Quechua. &#x201c;No glass.&#x201d;<br><br>She ducked under the hinged access section without comment and opened a cooler cabinet on the floor. Hooked out the bottle and straightened up, gripping it not unlike the criollas in the ad panels outside. Then she cracked it deftly open with a rust-spotted key that hung off her belt, and set it on the bar.<br><br>&#x201c;Five soles.&#x201d;<br><br>The only currency he had on him was Bolivian. He dug out a COLIN wafer and held it up between two fingers. &#x201c;Swipe okay?&#x201d;<br><br>She gave him a long-suffering look and went to get the machine. He checked the time display in the upper left corner of the Cebe lenses, then took them off. They&#x2019;d cycled for low light anyway, but he wanted clear eye contact for what was coming. He dumped his hat on the bartop and propped himself next to it, facing the room. Did his best to look like someone who didn&#x2019;t want anything, like someone fitting in.<br><br>In theory, he should have checked in with the GH site manager on arrival. It was procedure, written into the Charter. Extensive previous experience, some of it sticky with his own blood, had taught him not to bother. There was a whole shifting topography of dislike out there for what Carl Marsalis was, and it touched on pretty much every level of human wiring. At the high cognitive end, you had sophisticated dinner-party politics that condemned his professional existence as amoral. At a more emotive level there was the generalized social revulsion that comes with the label turncoat. And lower still, riding the arid terminology of the Jacobsen Report but swooping into the hormonal murk of instinct, you could find a rarely admitted but nonetheless giddy terror that he was, despite everything, still one of them.<br><br>And worse than all of this, in the eyes of the Colony corporations, Carl was bad press walking. Bad press and a guaranteed hole in finances. By the time someone like Gray was ready for shipping out, Garrod Horkan could expect to have plowed several tens of thousands of dollars into him in varied training and mesh biotech. Not the sort of investment you want bleeding out into the altiplano dust under the headline insufficient security at colin camp!<br><br>Four years previously, he&#x2019;d announced himself to the site manager at a camp south of La Paz, and his target had mysteriously vanished while Carl was still filling out forms in the administration building. There was a bowl of soup still steaming on the kitchen table when he walked into the prefab, a spoon still in the soup. The back door was open, and so was an emptied trunk at the foot of the bed in the next room. The man never surfaced again, and Carl had to conclude, to himself and to the Agency, that he was now, in all probability, on Mars. No one at COLIN was going to confirm that one way or the other, so he didn&#x2019;t bother asking.<br><br>Six months after that, Carl announced himself late one evening to another site manager, declined to fill in the forms until later, and was set upon by five men with baseball bats as he exited the admin office. Fortunately, they weren&#x2019;t professionals, and in the dark they got in one another&#x2019;s way. But by the time he&#x2019;d wrested one of the bats free for himself and driven his attackers off, the whole camp was awake. The street was lit up with flashlights and the news was spreading at speed; there was a new black face, an outsider, down at the admin building, causing trouble. Carl didn&#x2019;t even bother braving the streets and streets of stares to check on the camp address he had for his target. He already knew what he&#x2019;d find. That left the fallout from the fight, which was equally predictable. Despite numerous passersby and even one or two blatant spectators, there were suddenly no useful witnesses. The man Carl had managed to hurt badly enough that he couldn&#x2019;t run away remained steadfastly silent about his reasons for the assault. The site manager refused to let Carl question him alone, and cut short even the supervised interrogation on medical grounds. The prisoner has rights, she iterated slowly, as if Carl weren&#x2019;t very bright. You&#x2019;ve already hurt him badly.<br><br>Carl, still oozing blood from a split cheek and guessing at least one of his fingers was broken, just looked at her.<br><br>These days, he notified the site managers after the event.<br><br>&#x201c;Looking for an old friend,&#x201d; he told the waitress when she got back with the machine. He gave her the COLIN wafer and waited until she&#x2019;d swiped it. &#x201c;Name of Rodriguez. It&#x2019;s very important that I find him.&#x201d;<br><br>Her fingers hovered over the punch pad. She shrugged.<br><br>&#x201c;Rodriguez is a common name.&#x201d;<br><br>Carl took out one of the hardcopy downloads from the Bogot� clinic and slid it across the bartop at her. It was a vanity shot, system-generated to show clients what they&#x2019;d look like when the swelling went down. In real time, that soon after surgery that cheap, Gray&#x2019;s new face probably wouldn&#x2019;t have looked amiss on a Jesusland lynching victim, but the man smiling up out of the clinic print looked uninjured and pleasantly unremarkable. Broad cheekbones, wide mouth, an off-the-rack Amerind makeover. Carl, eternally paranoid about these things, had Matthew go back into the clinic dataflow that night just to make sure they weren&#x2019;t trying to fob him off with an image from stock. Matthew grumbled, but he did it, in the end probably just to prove he could. There was no doubt. Gray looked like this now.<br><br>The waitress glanced incuriously down at the print for a moment, then punched up an amount on the wafer that certainly wasn&#x2019;t five soles. She nodded up the bar to where a bulky fair-haired male leaned at the other end, staring into a shot glass as if he hated it.<br><br>&#x201c;Ask him.&#x201d;<br><br>Carl&#x2019;s hand whipped out, mesh-swift. He&#x2019;d dosed up that morning. He hooked her index finger before it could hit the transaction key. He twisted slightly, just enough to take the slack out of the knuckle joints. He felt the finger bones lock tig...</p><h2>Disney Frozen - Magic Wand and Storybook Set Sound Book - PI Kids</h2><p>Fearless&nbsp;optimist Anna sets off on&nbsp;an epic journey&#x2014;teaming up with rugged mountain man Kristoff and his&nbsp;loyal&nbsp;reindeer Sven&#x2014;to find her sister Elsa, whose icy powers have&nbsp;trapped the&nbsp;kingdom of Arendelle in eternal winter.

While this is one of theology's jobs, it is by no means the only, nor even the most important, one. Theology has also been called to change the world, to help people connect deeply rooted beliefs about the world's source and goal to questions of personal meaning and communal thriving. Theology is here to help us make sense of the complex, flawed world into which we've been thrust and to assist us in our attempt to love our neighbors and live toward the common good.</p><p>For more than forty years, the Workgroup on Constructive Theology has brought the liberal and liberationist theological traditions into creative encounter with lived human experience. In this introduction to the methods and tasks of theology, they invite a new generation of readers, many who will have little or no exposure to Christian doctrine, to see theology as a partner in the struggle for a better world. They demonstrate how theological ideas have "legs," playing themselves out not only in religious communities but in the public square as well. Theology, the authors tell us, is constructive when it joins in God's work of building human lives and human societies. Readers will learn to think about all of life in light of their religious commitments and to see theology as an essential tool for a life well lived.</p></p><p><p><b>Laurel C.

Her design career survived fifty-six successful and productive years. Lanvin is the oldest surviving couture house, in near-continuous existence from 1909 through the present day. Her body of work includes millinery, children&#x2019;s wear, haute couture, fragrances, furs, lingerie, menswear, and interior design among others. The continuous public appeal and the youthful image of these couture creations are lasting aspects of Madame Lanvin&#x2019;s career. At the heart of this book are key collections from 1909 through 1946, the year of Lanvin&#x2019;s death. Original fashion illustrations, beading and embroidery swatches play a crucial role in demonstrating her intricate, creative, and innovative techniques. The house of Lanvin is currently experiencing a period of great acclaim, emerging as a darling of the press, Hollywood, and the larger fashion community. With the most modern of efforts, Alber Elbaz, the current design director, is drawing from the rich Lanvin tradition to create an award-winning collection that at once evokes, reveres, and reinvents the intentions of its founder.</p><p><b>Dean Merceron</b> is an authority on 20th-century French fashion and is a contributor to the Encyclopedia of Clothing and Fashion. Harold Koda is Curator of the Costume Institute at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Alber Elbaz is the current Design Director of Lanvin.&#34;THE HOUSE OF LANVIN evolved from the creative force and remarkable energy of an extraordinary woman, Jeanne Lanvin.&#34;i(Fig. 1-00) The design career of Jeanne Lanvin survived fifty-six successful and productive years-- Lanvin was the oldest surviving couture house in continuous existence, from 1909 to 1993, a period of eightyfour years. Lanvin still exists in its original location as a luxury goods and ready-to-wear business for men and women, and the house now has boutiques around the world. But to this day, compared with more famous names such as Gabrielle &#34;Coco&#34; Chanel or Paul Poiret, many people remain unaware of the identity and many achievements of Jeanne Lanvin as well as her contributions to the fashion industry and the world of design in general. The longevity of this couture house may be attributed to the untiring force and determination of a woman driven by the relentless need to create, succeed, and excel within her chosen field among many worthy, predominantly male, contemporaries. Fueled by the single-minded devotion to her daughter, Marguerite Marie-Blanche, her love for and focus on the child manifested itself in the most inspired, creative, and feminine fashions (Fig. 1-00). Also contributing to the longevity of the couture house was her versatility. Madame Lanvin successfully melded the Lanvin image with the changing desires and needs of fickle fashion clientele. (Fig, 1-00) The house of Lanvin image was clearly defined and redefined from season to season, and always maintained its image of youth, femininity, and beauty. Madame Lanvin was a fashion leader and innovator in the twenties, using original colors and innovative surface decorationsthat ensured the distinctiveness of her creations. Although the garments are masterfully constructed, the true appeal and originality of these designs is in the surface detail and embellishment. The origin and influences of these beading and embroidery designs are of great importance and interest. The stylings at Lanvin were not necessarily the same as those being offered by other leading fashion houses, but were consistently recognized with accolades and impressive sales. Madame Lanvin offered a vast array of styles and options catering to women of all ages and their unique needs. She managed to maintain her style and adjusted her perspective with the vicissitudes of fashion. (Fig. 1-04) Marguerite was her muse; her youthful and contemporary perspective served to sustain the fresh and up-to-date image of the fashion house. When one actually examines a Lanvin product, it is quite obvious why the couture house remained in favor with a loyal international clientele for such a long time. Madame Lanvin&#39;s artistic sensibility and creative spirit is evident in even the simplest of forms. (Fig. 1-05, 06, 07) She collected books, textiles, and assorted artifacts on her world travels. (Fig. 1-08) She is one of the few designers of her time who successfully drew inspiration from colors, motifs, and symbols inspired by visits to cathedrals, museums, and art galleries. There is a small but important difference between &#34;being inspired by&#34; and &#34;using&#34; something as an inspiration. &#34;Being inspired by&#34; allows one to draw upon the essence of an object, a color, or an image to produce something original. &#34;Using&#34; something as an inspiration implies a literal translation in the design process. There is no original thought or creativity required, only appropriation. Madame Lanvin was a designer who could successfully extract elements and incorporate them into viable, modern, and functional design. An excellent example of this is the development of her signature color, &#34;Lanvin blue.&#34; Examining the Patrimoine Lanvin suggests that it was inspired by a color present in frescoes created by Fra Angelico (Fig. 1-00). However, other texts state that the blue color derived from cobalt in medieval stained glass was the inspiration for &#34;Lanvin blue.&#34; There is no definitive proof to resolve the contradiction, but over the years many creations consistently appearing in Lanvin collections extract from or reference the works of Fra Angelico. It is clear that Fra Angelico was a source of inspiration for her and undoubtedly &#34;Lanvin blue&#34; was inspired, at least in part, by the same blue color consistently found in in Fra Angelico.</p><h2>Trumbull Park (New England Library Of Black Literature)</h2><p>Frank London Brown&#x2019;s powerful debut novel, originally published in 1959, fictionalizes the real-life ordeals of the first black families to integrate Chicago&#x2019;s Trumbull Park public housing project in the 1950s.

The night breezes were relentless in their irregular keening, the soft, lonely sounds trailing over heaps of dry and crumbling soil, lingering in the corners and dark spaces of the long lost city. Like the gentle cries of shades and spirits lamenting the daily disturbances of their tomb.</p><p>Sometimes, particularly at night when he couldn't sleep, Jacob Isaac Sisko thought he might like to write about those ancient spirits -- a short piece of fiction, or even a poem -- but those instances were few and far between. For the first time in years he had put aside his writing padd, and for the time being, at least, he didn't miss it much. Besides, by the end of each day, he was usually too exhausted to do more than eat, pull off his boots, and crawl into his cot, the sheets heavy with dust in spite of the air recycler. His sleep was deep and peaceful, and if he dreamed, he didn't remember upon waking.</p><p><i>Last night, though...</i></p><p>He wasn't quite ready to think about that; he concentrated instead on the small patch of dry and faded earth beneath his fingers, on the feel of the brush in his hand as he carefully dusted. Behind him, Prylar Eivos droned on about some of the recent discoveries in the southernmost section of the dig, his ponderous voice seeming to draw the very life out of the tunnel's cool, recycled air. Eivos was a nice enough man, but probably the most dreadfully dry of all the student overseers; the aging monk seemed to be perfectly happy with the sound of his own voice, regardless of whether or not the content was relevant to anything. Jake tuned in for a moment, still brushing at what would almost certainly turn out to be yet another pottery shard.</p><p>"...but there was one figurine among the rest that was carved out of jevonite, which is nothing short of extraordinary," the prylar said, his tone suggesting that he'd devoted great thought to the matter. "As you know, it has always been believed that jevonite could be found only on Cardassia..."</p><p>Jake tuned out again, paying just enough attention to know when to nod respectfully. From farther down the tunnel he could hear the soft hum of the solids detectors and the repetitive <i>chunk</i> of manually worked picks and shovels. They were pleasant sounds, a bright counterpart to the nights of ghostly crying from ancestors not his own....</p><p>He was feeling a bit on the poetic side lately, wasn't he? It was strange, unearthing fragments from an ancient culture, and stranger still that the culture wasn't even his -- </p><p><i> -- Dad's, though, in a way, and in the dream -- </i></p><p>He shut that thought down before it could get any further, afraid of the concomitant feelings, afraid of what he might uncover. And he realized that, beneath the soft bristles of his brush, a sliver of color had appeared, a dull red against the lighter soil.</p><p>Jake waited for a break in Prylar Eivos's oratory.</p><p>"...but then, quantum-dating of the jevonite artifacts unearthed at the site proves indisputably that they actually predate the First Hibetian civilization," the monk stated firmly, and took a deep breath.</p><p>"I think I've found it," Jake said quickly.</p><p>The prylar smiled, stepping forward and crouching, using the tunnel wall as a support. He pulled his own brush from a fold in his robes and whisked the remaining soil from around the piece with practiced ease. As Jake suspected, it was another broken clay shard. For every intact relic that was uncovered at B'hala, there seemed to be about a billion broken ones.</p><p><i>And they all have to be catalogued.</i></p><p>"Let's see what we have here...ah, very good, Jake!" The prylar stepped back, reaching for one of the innumerable trays on the nearby cart. "And how gratifying -- it's kejelious, one of the most important materials used during the Sh'dama Age. Have I ever told you about kejelious? I don't know if anyone truly appreciates how versatile it can be, when the liquid ratios are altered..."</p><p>Jake nodded, smiling, seeing no point in reminding the monk that he'd already heard all about the virtues of the stuff, twice. Eivos really was a nice old guy, and seemed to be genuinely excited about the work -- though for the first time in all his weeks at B'hala Jake found himself feeling disappointed, gazing at the slender fragment as the monk eased it from the ground.</p><p><i>Maybe because it's not what you came here to find,</i> his mind whispered, and it was another thought that he pushed away -- but not so quickly as he might have only a few days before. Things were changing whether he liked it or not, and though he knew it was inevitable, had known for some weeks, a part of him was still fighting to avoid the next step.</p><p><i>Acceptance.</i></p><p>When the prylar suggested that they break for a meal, Jake was relieved. He hurried away, suddenly eager to be out of the tunnels where the dead were dust and wind, where his father was a ghost that could only be longed for.</p><p></p><p>It was late in the afternoon before he thought of it again.</p><p><i>The dream, Jake. Last night.</i></p><p>He felt a tingle at the back of his neck, a subtle shiver of remembered dream-reality -- something about the wormhole...?</p><p>Jake sighed, still not sure he wanted to remember. Not sure he was ready, in spite of the fact that he'd been having trouble concentrating for the last several days, really. He was alone in one of the smaller catalog rooms, a constant, soft drone of activity filtering in through several openings that had once been windows; he leaned back in his chair and closed his eyes, breathing deeply.</p><p>As far down as they were, second level up from the tunnels, it was always pleasantly cool, and although a lot of the volunteers preferred to work in the larger, climate-controlled areas, he liked the fresh air. Usually it kept him alert, but he'd been daydreaming since lunch. Well, since breakfast, technically, although working with Prylar Eivos would make an android's mind wander....</p><p>Jake opened his eyes and returned his attention to the shard he'd been handling, one of several from the area he thought of as the Kitchens, over at the northeast end of the partially unearthed city. Number, 1601; Designation, C/Utensil. The familiar numbers and keys of the database portable flew; he hardly had to look at the container tag, knowing from the curve and distinctive blue color that it was another one of the goblet sets. He'd catalogued at least thirty of them in the last few days, all from the same coordinates. Standard estimation comments from Prylar Krish, noted date of extraction...</p><p>...and had he been in the wormhole with his father? It seemed so distant, but he thought that the dream had been about him and Dad, together, flying...</p><p>Jake set the piece of clay aside, knowing that he had to stop dancing away from the truth of things. Away from the gentle physical and mental repetition that his time at B'hala had been about, and toward why he had come.</p><p><i>To accept the fact that I have to go on without him.</i></p><p>The hesitant thought, so simply worded on the page in his mind's eye, struck him as a little trite -- but no less true or powerful for that. When no paralyzing sorrow came, he allowed the thought again, accepting the heaviness in his throat and chest. For now, at least, he had to make a life for himself.</p><p>It hurt, but there was also a forced quality to it. Or, not forced, but...deliberate. He knew what had to happen, what he was supposed to do, but he didn't <i>feel</i> it yet.</p><p><i>But Dax said that's normal, didn't she? That it could be a gradual thing, or all at once.</i> Ezri had been very straightforward about what he might experience, telling him not to underestimate or belittle his loss, and to keep his expectations to a minimum. He'd talked to her a few times, before and after leaving the station, carefully skirting any real conversation about his father. When he'd told her about his intention to join the B'hala excavation, she'd suggested that not thinking for a while might be exactly what he needed; in the almost nine weeks since he'd started, Jake had come to agree wholeheartedly.</p><p>He'd been invited just about everywhere on Bajor after his father's disappearance. Like Kas, Jake had politely turned down each hopeful request -- to speak at schools, to lead prayer groups, to extend blessings over everything from local harvest festivals to the openings of new business ventures. Kasidy had received twice as many offers; he was the Emissary's son, but Kasidy was carrying the Emissary's unborn child, a somehow more miraculous connection. They'd shared a quiet laugh about it the last time they'd talked, some small joke that was more affectionate than funny. Jake loved her for that, and had been glad to see how well she looked. Kasidy had the celebrated pregnancy glow about her, even if her eyes were a little sad.</p><p><i>You're still dancing, Jake, avoiding the inevitable -- </i></p><p>Jake scowled at his inner voice. If it was inevitable, why rush? It wasn't like he was on a schedule.</p><p>Although he hadn't realized it at the time, getting away from the station had been the best thing he could've done. The initial invitation to visit B'hala had been extended by a branch of the Order of the Temple, the prylars who primarily worked the dig, and had been offered as a chance to experience Bajoran history firsthand. Being the Emissary's son surely had plenty to do with it, but Jake appreciated the less-obvious wording. He knew that B'hala had been a special place for his father. And the fact of it was, the station had been too empty without Dad, and the looks of sympathy -- or worse, the well-meant platitudes from the Bajoran segment, about the Emissary's great calling -- had only served to remind Jake of just how much he missed his father. Kas had been great, and his friends, especially Ezri and Nog, but B'hala had been what he needed. He'd heard about the volunteer program -- usually open only to religious initiates -- on the second night of what had started as a four-day visit, and had only been back to the station once, to pick up a few personal items.</p><p>He'd had time here.

It is the indispensable basis for making our way in the world as individuals and in community with others, and the starting point for finding truth and building scientific knowledge. The philosophy of common-sense realism deeply informed the American Founders&#x2019; vision for a self-governing people, in a society where leaders and average citizens share essentially the same understanding of reality&#x2015;of what simply <i>makes sense</i>.<br><br> But today our confidence in the value and reliability of common sense has been badly shaken. Deep thinkers have rejected it. Elites have learned to disdain it. We&#x2019;re told that we have moved into a more sophisticated world, where common sense is pass� and the very concept of <i>truth</i> is outmoded. Indeed, the Oxford Dictionaries selected &#x201c;post-truth&#x201d; as the Word of the Year for 2016.<br><br> Do we actually live in a post-truth reality? Have we moved beyond common sense? <i>Can</i> we?<br><br> In this book, Robert Curry exposes the absurdity of the attacks on common sense, and demonstrates that we still live and move in the realm of common sense in our every waking moment. Drawing from philosophy and literature, science and psychiatry, <i>Reclaiming Common Sense</i> helps us regain our trust in the &#x201c;superpower&#x201d; we all have in common, while reminding us that we cannot get along without it.</p><p>Robert Curry is the author of&nbsp;<i>Common Sense Nation: Unlocking the Forgotten Power of the American Idea</i>&nbsp;(Encounter Books).&nbsp;He serves on the Board of Directors of the Claremont Institute. His articles and reviews have appeared in <i>American Greatness</i>, the <i>American Thinker</i>, the <i>Claremont Review of Books</i>, the <i>Federalist</i>, and the <i>Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism</i>.&#x201c;In the modern intellectual climate, the basic rationality of common sense has been unsettled, and sometimes altogether eclipsed, by dreamworld ideologies and personal &#x2018;truths&#x2019; asserted in defiance of elementary facts of experience. The revolt against common sense has moved beyond the universities to take hold of our political and cultural institutions, in coercive government policies and public shaming. Against the feverish assault, Robert Curry sounds a note of cool sanity, presenting common sense in simple (though not simplistic) terms and illustrating it in living color. For level-headed readers disoriented by the craziness, this little book will be a bracing tonic.&#x201d;<br> &#x2015;Scott Philip Segrest, Associate Professor of Political Science at The Citadel and author of&nbsp;<i>America and the Political Philosophy of Common Sense</i> <br><br> &#x201c;In his second companion volume about common sense, Robert Curry again reminds us that our leisured and affluent society periodically dismisses the fundamental Western way of knowledge that ensures our collective success. Or at least it says it does in its periodic relativist, romantic, and emotional flirtations with thoughts that are not grounded in reality. This book is a much-needed reminder in our postmodern age that what works and what we perceive to be real are alone real.&#x201d;<br> &#x2015;Victor Davis Hanson, Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution, Stanford University, and author of&nbsp;<i>The Second World Wars: How the First Global Conflict Was Fought and Won</i> <br><br> &#x201c;In his entertaining, insightful, and highly literate new book, Robert Curry gives the &#x2018;superpower&#x2019; that is common sense its proper due. Here&#x2019;s hoping that members of the political class read Curry&#x2019;s book, and in so doing find within themselves the humble qualities that might cause them to do less so that we the people can do more.&#x201d;<br> &#x2015;John Tamny, Vice President of FreedomWorks <br><br> &#x201c;What Robert Curry started simply and beautifully in&nbsp;<i>Common Sense Nation</i>&nbsp;he continues in&nbsp;<i>Reclaiming Common Sense</i>: the revival, defense, and application of the principles needed to save America and Western civilization.&#x201d;<br> &#x2015;Ryan P. Williams, President of the Claremont Institute and Publisher of the <i>Claremont Review of Books</i> <br><br> &#x201c;Having recovered in&nbsp;<i>Common Sense Nation</i>&nbsp;the important role of common sense on the nation&#x2019;s founding, Robert Curry has written a thoughtful, passionate analysis of the social and political ills that have followed the abandonment of common sense in our country&#x2019;s culture. From appeasement of jihadism to the follies of self-selected gender identities, Curry provides a powerful, must-read warning of the dangers to our principles of self-government and our political freedom by neglecting &#x2018;common sense realism&#x2019; in our policies both at home and abroad.&#x201d; <br> &#x2015;Bruce S.

In 1962 hecreated the master thief Parker and began a series of novels that have been recognized as seminal works of crime fiction. Several of Westlake&#x2019;s books have been adapted by Hollywood and Westlake&#x2019;s adaptation of The Grifters earned him an Academy Award nomination for best motion picture screenplay. Westlake has won numerous awards for his fiction and in 1993 the Mystery Writers of America named him a Grand Master, the highest honor bestowed by that prestigious society.<br><br><b>Darwyn Cooke</b>&nbsp;(1962-2015) was a graphic designer and animator who turned his attention toward cartooning in the late nineties. Known primarily for his work on the DC line of superheroes, Cooke always had an affinity for crime fiction and has often cited the Parker books as a great source of creative inspiration. Cooke has won multiple Eisner, Harvey, and Shuster awards, as well as the National Cartoonist Society&#x2019;s Best Series award. In 2008 Cooke was Emmy-nominated for the animated adaptation of his magnum opus, <i>DC:</i>&nbsp;<i>The New Frontier</i>.*Starred Review* Cooke garnered all sorts of acclaim (including the 2010 Eisner Award for Best Adaptation) for translating Donald Westlake&#x2019;s ruthless antihero Parker (the Parker novels were written under Westlakes pseudonym Richard Stark) into comics form with The Hunter, and here he returns with an even stronger follow-up. The crime syndicate that professional heister Parker so royally pissed off (they pissed him off first, to be fair) in the last book finds him languishing in Miami Beach with a surgically transformed face. The syndicates attempted hit goes wrong, and Parker shifts back into his relentless vengeance gear (he never smiles, but you get the sense he&#x2019;s happiest brawling and shooting his way through impossible odds) as he calls in a few favors from his underworld associates and goes after the head of the outfit. Cooke leans less heavily on large chunks of Stark&#x2019;s prose here than in the first book and flexes some serious cartooning muscle, from the stylishly visualized early-60s milieu to the sweet timing of the wordless action sequences to a virtuosic series of mini-heists, each drawn in a different style that highlights Cooke&#x2019;s considerable range, impeccable linework, and diligent grasp of graphic design. Even the deceptively simple coloring&#x2014;just a few shades of blue that slash grim crags beneath Parker&#x2019;s glaring eyes and swirl plumes of cigarette smoke in the dark&#x2014;exudes pure noir silkiness. It&#x2019;s a credit to both the source and Cooke&#x2019;s considerable skill, but straight-up crime fare (comics or not) doesn&#x2019;t get much more gratifying. --Ian Chipman</p><h2>Imprints: The Pokagon Band of Potawatomi Indians and the City of Chicago</h2><p>The Pokagon Band of Potawatomi Indians has been a part of Chicago since its founding.

An accomplished pianist, socially active&#x2014;and what style! &#x201c;You are what you wear&#x201d; is her motto. But Ginger&#x2019;s greatest passion is her pet pig, Petunia, whom she pampers endlessly. When Ginger is called out of town for a performance, Petunia is left on her own. Donning Ginger&#x2019;s stunning gowns, Petunia poses as Ginger and conducts business as usual, with no one the wiser. Hilarity ensues as Petunia becomes the toast of the town, proving Ginger&#x2019;s motto that you really are what you wear.</p><p>"I was born in Lansing, Michigan in 1944. Soon after my birth I lived in Williamston, Michigan and then moved onto my grandparents farm in Union City, Michigan.<p>"I lived on the farm with my mom and Grandparents until 1949. That is when my Babushka (my grandmother) died and we prepared to move away from Michigan. I must say that living on that little farm with them was the most magical time of my life...and that my Babushka and other grandparents were some of the most inspirational people in my life.</p><p>"My parents were divorced when I was 3, and both my father and mother moved back into the homes of their parents. I spent the school year with my mother, and the summers with my dad. In both households I was the apple of my grandparents' eyes! I would say that these relationships with my grandparents have most definitely influenced my life and my work. You probably have noticed that in almost every book that I write there is a very young person who is interacting with an elderly person. Personally, I feel that this is the most valuable experience of my life....having the wonder of knowing both children and elderly people.</p><p>"The respect that I learned as a very young person certainly carried over into my life in later years. I have always like hearing stories from these folks. My genuine curiosity for the wonder of living a very long life prepared me to accept the declining years of my own parents.</p><p>"To get back to the farm in Union City...this place was so magical to me that I have never forgotten it! This was the place where I heard such wonderful stories told...this was the place that a real meteor fell into our font yard...that very meteorite is now our family headstone in the graveyard here in Union City.</p><p>"Did I tell you that I now live in Union City? This is after living in Oakland, California for almost 37 years. But, you see, every year I'd come back to Michigan to see my Dad and family.</p><p>"Anyway...</p><p>"In 1949 we left the farm to move, first to Coral Gables, Florida. I lived there with my Mom and my brother, Richard, for almost 3 years. Then we moved to Oakland, California. I remained there for most of my young life on into my adulthood. We lived on Ocean View Drive in the Rockridge District. What I loved the most about this neighborhood is that all of my neighbors came in as many colors, ideas and religions as there are people on the planet. How lucky I was to know so many people that were so different and yet so much alike.</p><p>"It is on Ocean View that I met my best friend, Stewart Grinnell Washington. We are best friends to this day! He has a younger brother, Winston and three sisters; Jackie, Terry and Robin. When I was a student in elementary school I wasn't a very good student. I had a terrible time with reading and math. As a matter of fact, I did not learn how to read until I was almost 14 years old. Can you imagine what it was like to see all my friends do so well in school and I wasn't! I thought I was dumb. I didn't like school because there was this boy that always teased me and made me feel even dumber. When I was fourteen, it was learned that I have a learning disability. It is called dyslexia. I felt trapped in a body that wouldn't do what everybody else could do. That was when one of my hero's, my teacher, found what was wrong with me and got me the help I needed to succeed in school. Of course, now that I am an adult, I realize that being learning disabled does not mean DUMB AT ALL! As a matter of fact, I have learned that being learning disabled only means that I cannot learn the way most of you do. As a matter of fact, most learning disabled children are actually GENIUSES! Once I learned how to read and caught up with the rest of my fellow students, I did very well.</p><p>"I went on to University, majored in Fine Art, then went on to do a graduate degree and even ended up with a Ph.D. in Art History. For a time I restored ancient pieces of art for museums. I eventually became the mother of two children, Steven and Traci, and devoted much of my days to their education and upbringing.</p><p>"I did not start writing children's books until I was 41 years old. Mind you the "art" has always been there for me most of my life. Apparently one of the symptoms of my disability in academics is the ability of draw very, very well. So drawing, painting and sculpture has always been a part of my life even before I started illustrating my books. The books were quite a surprise, really. Mind you, I came from a family of incredible storytellers. My mother's people were from the Ukraine and Russia...my father's people were from Ireland. My extended family,(Stewart's family) were from the bayous of Louisiana...also great story tellers. When you are raised on HEARING stories.....NOT SEEING THEM, you become very good at telling stories yourself. So at the age of 41 I started putting stories that I told down on paper and did drawings to help illustrate them...I guess the rest is history.</p><p>"I have enjoyed a wonderful career of writing books for children . Who could have guessed that little girl that was having such a tough time in school would end up an illustrator and author. Children and adults alike ask me where I get my ideas...I get them from the same place that you do....MY IMAGINATION... I would guess the reason my imagination is so fertile is because I came from storytelling and, WE DID NOT OWN A T.V.!!!!!!!!! You see, when one is a writer, actor, dancer, musician; a creator of any kind, he or she does these things because they listen to that "voice" inside of them. All of us have that "voice". It is where all inspired thoughts come from....but when you have electronic screens in front, of you, speaking that voice for you... it DROWNS OUT THE VOICE! When I talk to children and aspiring writers, I always ask them to listen to the voice, turn off the T.V. and</p><p>"LISTEN...LISTEN...LISTEN.</p><p>"Now that I have moved back to Union City I am intending to open my house and community and invite people to come there to take part in writing seminars, story telling festivals, literature conferences and various events that celebrate children's literature."</p><p>Born Patricia Ann Barber in Lansing, Michigan, to parents of Russian and Ukrainian descent on one side and Irish on the other, Patricia Polacco grew up in both California and Michigan. Her school year was spent in Oakland, California, and summers in her beloved Michigan. She describes her family members as marvelous storytellers. "My fondest memories are of sitting around a stove or open fire, eating apples and popping corn while listening to the old ones tell glorious stories about their homeland and the past. We are tenacious traditionalists and sentimentalists.... With each retelling our stories gain a little more Umph!"</p><p>Studying in the United States and Australia, Patricia Polacco has earned an M.F.A. and a Ph. D. in art history, specializing in Russian and Greek painting, and iconographic history. She is a museum consultant on the restoration of icons. As a participant in many citizen exchange programs for writers and illustrators, Patricia Polacco has traveled extensively in Russia as well as other former Soviet republics. She continues to support programs that encourage Russo-American friendships and understanding. She is also deeply involved in inner-city projects here in the U.S. that promote the peaceful resolution of conflict and encourage art and literacy programs.</p><p>The mother of a grown son and a daughter, Patricia Polacco currently resides in Michigan, where she has a glorious old farm that was built during the time of Lincoln.</p><p>copyright � 2000 by Penguin Putnam Books for Young Readers.

She also has a closet full of flashy clothes ("'You are what you wear,' she always says") and plenty of makeup that she applies liberally. As if that's not enough to make her a bit unusual, Ginger has a pig named Petunia. She adores her pet so much that the porker's rather elaborate house is under the staircase and her every whim is catered to, including a fabulous outdoor mud hole with a gazebo over it. ("'My Petunia does so love her mud soaks,' Ginger always says.") But when the pampered pet is accidentally left to fend for herself for a few days, the fun really begins. She fills in for Ginger, attending openings and parties, wearing Ginger's clothes and makeup; the fact that no one notices is hilarious. Polacco's illustrations are filled with movement and humor. The dance sequence with the governor ("Petunia grabbed his ankles and swung him round and round and up into the huge vat of chocolate mousse") is worth the price of the book.&#x2014;<i>Lee Bock, Glenbrook Elementary School, Pulaski, WI</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

But the calm she so desperately seeks is shattered when, out riding a horse, she comes upon the body of a young woman who has been brutally murdered. The girl's wounds are identical to those inflicted on the victims of Jack the Ripper, who has wreaked havoc across the channel in London. Emily feels a connection to the young woman and is determined to bring the killer to justice.</p><p> Pursuing a trail of clues and victims to the beautiful medieval city of Rouen and a crumbling ch�teau in the country, Emily begins to worry about her own sanity: She hears the cries of a little girl she cannot find and discovers blue ribbons left in the child's wake. As Emily is forced to match wits with a brilliant and manipulative killer, only her courage, keen instincts, and formidable will to win can help her escape becoming his next victim.</p></p><p>The daughter of two philosophy professors, I grew up surrounded by books. I was convinced from an early age that I was born in the wrong century and spent much of my childhood under the dining room table pretending it was a covered wagon. Even there, I was never without a book in hand and loved reading and history more than anything. I studied English Literature and Medieval History at the University of Notre Dame. Writing is a natural offshoot of reading, and my first novel,&nbsp;<i>And Only to Deceive</i>, was published in 2005. I'm the New York Times Bestselling author of the long-running Lady Emily Series as well as the novel&nbsp;<i>Elizabeth: The Golden Age</i>. One of the best parts of being an author is seeing your books translated, and I'm currently in love with the Japanese editions of the Emily books.&nbsp;<br><br><br>I played nomad for a long time, living in Indiana, Amsterdam, London, Wyoming, Vermont, Connecticut, and Tennessee before settling down. My husband, the brilliant British novelist&nbsp;Andrew Grant&nbsp;(I may be biased but that doesn't mean I'm wrong) and I now divide our time between Chicago and Wyoming. He makes sure I get my English characters right, and I make sure his American ones sound American.<b>DANGEROUS TO KNOW (Chapter 1)</b> <p>Although a stranger to the Norman countryside, even I knew a dark pool of blood under a tree was not something a tourist should expect to see during an afternoon ride. Sliding down from the saddle, I put a calming hand on my horse&#x2019;s neck, then bent to investigate more closely. Had I been able to convince myself the congealing liquid was something less nefarious, the sight of a pale hand, blue fingertips extended, would have changed my mind at once. Without stopping to think, I rubbed my abdomen, the remnants of dull pain still present after my own encounter with violence, and took a step towards the body.</p><p>Only a few months ago, during what was meant to be a blissful honeymoon, I&#x2019;d been trapped in a cavernous cistern deep below the city of Constantinople with the villain who shot me in an attempt to keep quiet my discovery that he was guilty of murder. His efforts were, of course, in vain. But although I succeeded in exposing the odious man and saving the life of the sultan&#x2019;s concubine whom he&#x2019;d held as a hostage, I&#x2019;d lost something more dear. I did not know when I stepped into the gloomy bowels of the city that I was with child. Now, instead of preparing for an heir, my husband and I were no longer sure we could ever have one.</p><p>Colin Hargreaves was not a man to be daunted, even in the face of such tragedy. He insisted that nothing mattered but my recovery and packed me off to France the moment I was well enough to travel. His intentions were the best. His choice of location, however, fell something short of perfection. Not Normandy itself&#x2014;the lush countryside was stunning, the rich, cream-laden food magnificent&#x2014;but our lodgings at his mother&#x2019;s house left something to be desired. Although that, too, is not entirely precise. There was nothing wrong with the manor, a sprawling, comfortable building constructed primarily in the seventeenth century by an aristocrat whose descendents did not fare well during the revolution. Rather, it was I who was the problem. At least so far as my new mother-in-law was concerned.</p><p>I&#x2019;d heard nothing but complimentary words about Mrs. Hargreaves, who had fled England after the death of her husband some ten years before. Her own father had been left a widower early, and encouraged his daughter to remain at home&#x2014;not to take care of him, but because he, not much fond of society, felt she should be allowed to lead whatever sort of life she liked. His fortune ensured she would never need a husband for support. Free from the restraints of matrimony, Anne Howard passed nearly twenty years traveling the world while her girlhood friends married and had children. It was only when she reached her thirty-sixth year that, halfway up the Great Pyramid at Giza, she met Nicholas Hargreaves. By the time they were standing again on terra firma, the couple were engaged. Three days later they married, and afterwards, never spent a single night apart.</p><p>I had hoped Mrs. Hargreaves would shower me with the warmth she showed her son&#x2014;that she would rejoice to see him so happily matched. But after a fortnight of her cool detachment, I determined to spend as much time as possible away from the prickling discomfort of her disapproving stare, and it was this decision that led me to the unhappy resting place of the girl sprawled beneath a tree, her blood soaking the ground.</p><p>Bile burned my throat as I looked at her, my eyes drawn from her fingers to her face, framed by hair so similar in color and style to mine we might have been taken for twins. There was no question she was dead, no need to check for any sign of life. No one could have survived the brutal gashes on her throat. The bodice of her dress was black with blood and had been ripped at the abdomen, revealing what seemed to be an empty cavity.</p><p>I could look no further.</p><p>I wrapped my arms around my waist as my stomach clenched. I wasn&#x2019;t sick, but only because I was too horrified, too stunned even to breathe. Closing my eyes, I tried to focus, to move, to think, but was incapable of anything. I spun around at the sound of a sharp crack, like a branch breaking behind me, then turned back as my horse made a hideous shriek and reared. Realizing I&#x2019;d neglected to tie him to the tree, I started towards him, but was too late. He&#x2019;d already broken into a run.</p><p>Which left me six and a quarter miles from home, alone with the murdered girl.</p><p>Trees and grass and flowers spun around me as I tried to regain enough composure to take stock of the scene before me. I should have been better equipped to deal with this. In the past two years, I had become something of an investigator after solving the murder of my first husband, Philip, the Viscount Ashton, whom everyone had believed died of fever on a hunting trip in Africa. Since then, I&#x2019;d thrice more been asked to assist in murder cases, the last time while on my wedding trip in Constantinople. Colin, my second husband (and Philip&#x2019;s best friend), worked for the Crown, assisting in matters that required, as he liked to say, more than a modicum of discretion. Because no man could gain entrance to the sultan&#x2019;s harem, he had asked me to work with him in an official capacity when a concubine, who turned out to be the daughter of a British diplomat, was murdered at the Ottoman Palace.</p><p>Successful though I&#x2019;d been, none of my prior experience had prepared me for the sight before me now.</p><p>I squinted, blurring my vision so the field of poppies beyond the tree and the body melted into a wave of crimson buoyed by the wind. My boot slid on slick grass as I stepped forward and forced myself to look, memorizing every detail of the gruesome scene: the position of the girl&#x2019;s limbs, a description of her dress, the expression on her face. Simultaneously confident and sickened that I was capable of giving a thorough report of what I&#x2019;d seen, I turned and started the long walk back to the house, my stomach lurching, my heart leaping at every sound that came from the surrounding fields, my legs shaking.</p><p>For the briefest moment, I wanted to pretend that I&#x2019;d seen nothing, wanted to abandon myself to fear. Tears, ready to spill, flashed hot in my eyes, and I dug my fingernails into my palms. Which was when I heard a twig snap. I stopped long enough to see a rabbit scurrying across the path in front of me. And all at once, my fear turned to anger&#x2014;anger that I no longer felt safe in this place that was supposed to offer respite. Pulling myself up straight, I marched back to the house, ready to tell Colin we had work to do.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It had taken me more than two hours to reach Mrs. Hargreaves&#x2019;s manor, nestled in a tree-filled grove deep in the Norman countryside northwest of Rouen, but as long rides had become my daily habit, I had not thought my absence would strike anyone as unusual. Hence my surprise when my husband rushed to greet me almost as soon as I&#x2019;d opened the door. Overcome with relief at the sight of him, I collapsed into his arms, hardly pausing to breathe as the story tumbled from my lips.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re not hurt?&#x201d; he asked, patting my arms and taking a step back to inspect me.</p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; I said. He looked me over again and then, seemingly satisfied, took me inside, sent the nearest servant to get the police post-haste, and sat me down on an overstuffed settee in the front sitting room. His mother, who had been reading, set aside her book and rose with a look of horror on her face.</p><p>&#x201c;What has happened?&#x201d; she asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Emily has found a body,&#x201d; Colin said, pacing the perimeter of the room. Mrs. Hargreaves remained perfectly still, her face serious, as he recounted for her all that had transpired.</p><p>&#x201c;The police?&#x201d; she asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Are already on their way,&#x201d; he said and directed his attention back to me. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re quite certain of the location?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll have to show you. I don&#x2019;t know that I could explain how to get there,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I hadn&#x2019;t followed a specific route.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I was frantic when your horse came into the garden without you,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I wanted to look for you but had no idea what direction you&#x2019;d gone.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t imagine you frantic. You&#x2019;re beyond calm&#x2014;infuriatingly calm&#x2014;in the face of danger.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not, my dear, when it comes to you. Not anymore.&#x201d; He sat next to me and took my hand, rubbing it with both of his.</p><p>&#x201c;I will not stand for you going all protective,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Next thing I know you&#x2019;ll be sending me to bed early and censoring the books I read.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I know better than to try to influence your choice of reading material.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You do have excellent taste,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I might consider taking your advice.&#x201d;</p><p>His mother sighed loudly and all but rolled her eyes. &#x201c;I wish you would let me send for my physician to look her over, Colin,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Do you think, Lady Emily&#x201d;&#x2014;she insisted on addressing me formally, her voice full of sharp scorn, to remind me of her disapproval of the use of the courtesy title to which I, the daughter of an earl, was entitled&#x2014;&#x201c;that you&#x2019;ll be quite able to bear the sight of the body again? I can&#x2019;t help but worry about the constitution of such a delicate and sheltered girl.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be perfectly all right,&#x201d; I said, feeling my cheeks blush unpleasantly hot. &#x201c;Anyone would be upset by what I&#x2019;ve seen, but that doesn&#x2019;t mean I&#x2019;m incapable of doing the work necessary to ensure justice for the victim of this unspeakable crime.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And am I to believe you are better capable of achieving such a thing than the police?&#x201d; she asked. I had no time to reply as the butler announced Inspector Gaudet, a towering man, tall and broad, with a beard and handlebar mus...</p></p><h2>More about Paddington</h2><p><p>Paddington Bear becomes a celebrity when he takes portraits of the Brown family with a very old camera.

Truth is, creative types like me are driven by one impulse&#x2014;to make up a world in which we get to control everything and everyone. We decide who enters and who exits, what the weather will be, who will hook up with whom, who will win and who will lose. It makes us feel powerful and, in all honesty, has relatively little to do with thinking about what will make anyone else happy.</p><p>Which is why, at the end of pounding out three-hundred-plus pages, we are often surprised by how many of our friends, colleagues, fans, and family have generously helped us perfect our creations. And I suppose that&#x2019;s what tempers us a bit, to know that while we may love to play God, we still need some angels to help us get it right. It&#x2019;s these angels that I&#x2019;d like to humbly thank right now:</p><p>First and foremost, my incredible editor, Molly Boyle, who takes my overly wordy, addicted-to-adjectives manuscripts and turns them into what I <i>meant</i> to write. Molly, you&#x2019;re so good at what you do that you have not just impressed me&#x2014;you&#x2019;ve blown me away. I&#x2019;m unbelievably grateful for all your patience (didn&#x2019;t know you&#x2019;d need so much of that with me, did you?), your hard work, and your fantastic instincts. You and I shall make one helluva team, girlfriend&#x2014;thank you, thank you, thank you!</p><p>Next, my astounding and amazing agent, Jim McCarthy. What can I say that I haven&#x2019;t said before? (No, seriously, help me out here, cuz every time I mention you, I gush and gush and I&#x2019;m runnin&#x2019; out of gushy things to say!) LOL . . . Truly, Jim, I think you must be some sort of cosmic gift from the Big Guy upstairs who either took great pity on me or got me mixed up with some other far more deserving schmuck when he sent you my way. And just to be clear . . . if there was a screwup? I&#x2019;m <i>not</i> giving you back . . . ever! So plan on stickin&#x2019; around, sugar; we gots a looooong way to go just yet.</p><p>Adell Chase and Karen Ditmars, to whom this book is dedicated: Ladies, I&#x2019;ve been so lucky in my life. Everywhere I go, I meet the best of humanity, and a few of them, like you, I am blessed to call friends. You two leave me breathless with your wisdom, your courage, and your will to be strong, independent, smart, and capable women. When I grow up, I swear I want to be just like you two!</p><p>My sister Sandy Upham and my brother and sister-in-law Jon and Naoko Upham&#x2014;you guys have no idea how much I love you and how very much your support means to me. I&#x2019;m so proud of you three fantastic human beings that I&#x2019;m lucky enough to be related to. Huge hugs and kisses comin&#x2019; your way!</p><p>Also, a relative newcomer to my troupe of favorite people on earth, Michael Torres, aka The Boy. Thank you so much for the incredible way you inspire me, cheer me on, and never have an unkind word. You&#x2019;re such a beautiful man, M.T., both inside and out, and I&#x2019;m beyond thrilled that you&#x2019;ve come into my life. That morning phone call to cheer me on when I&#x2019;m in my writing slump is such a gift; please know that I appreciate and adore you for that and so much more.</p><p>Dr. Stephen Pap, who gave me the inspiration for Dr. Delicious, thank you first and foremost for fixing my hand&#x2014; which is all healed now, thank God&#x2014;and also for being so generous with your boyhood stories and background. I told you that you&#x2019;d make a great character&#x2014;I wasn&#x2019;t wrong.</p><p>And last but certainly not least, please let me thank all my incredible friends who have never wavered in their support, love, and encouragement: Kristy Schiller, Nora Brosseau, Silas Hudson, Laurie Comnes, Pipa Terry, Betty Stocking, Jaa Nawtaisong, and Leanne Tierney. You guys rock, and I&#x2019;m so grateful. &#x263a;</p><p><b>Chapter 1</b></p><p>&#x201c;Good morning, Miss Holliday,&#x201d; the real estate agent cheerfully greeted me outside 84 Dartmouth Street.</p><p>&#x201c;Hi, there. You must be Cassandra,&#x201d; I said, shaking her hand. &#x201c;Please call me M.J.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re younger and prettier than I thought you&#x2019;d be,&#x201d; she commented as she nervously twisted the pearls at her neck.</p><p>&#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; I said, then quickly got down to business. &#x201c;I know we talked a little on the phone, but what can you tell me about this house?&#x201d;</p><p>Cassandra paled slightly and looked up at the three-story brownstone, a turn-of-the-century gem that was right at home in Boston&#x2019;s opulent Back Bay neighborhood. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve had the listing for almost a year, which, as you can imagine, is unheard-of here in the Back Bay. Brownstones like this one sell around here in a matter of weeks, not months.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sticker shock?&#x201d; I asked.</p><p>&#x201c;No, nothing like that. At one million it&#x2019;s an absolute steal! And we&#x2019;ve had a lot of interest in it, despite its history. But every time we get close to making a deal, the buyer backs out. They all say the same thing: The place just has bad energy.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You said someone was killed inside?&#x201d;</p><p>Cassandra nodded. &#x201c;Yes, the daughter of the current owners was raped and murdered a little over a year ago.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s awful,&#x201d; I said, looking back toward the brownstone. &#x201c;Did they catch the killer?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He was shot by police as he tried to make a getaway out the back. Unfortunately, they arrived too late to save the girl.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So, really, two people died in the house.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, I suppose so,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>&#x201c;And what&#x2019;s been happening since then?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; she said, her hand going back to twist the pearls, &#x201c;every time I show the house I get the feeling I&#x2019;m being watched. And more than that, sometimes I feel like I&#x2019;m being followed. People come in and don&#x2019;t seem to want to stay. Most folks just take a tour of one or two rooms; then they leave like they&#x2019;re being chased out.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I see,&#x201d; I said, but I had a feeling there was more. &#x201c;Is that all?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; she said after a moment. &#x201c;The other day I was showing the house to this couple who really seemed to be okay with the history of the place. They considered it a good trade-off for such a bargain. But just as we were getting ready to leave, we all heard a woman&#x2019;s scream from one of the bedrooms upstairs. I thought someone had come in while I was showing the couple around, so I ran up there and looked all over but no one was there. Then, just as I was coming back downstairs, I felt . . .&#x201d; She paused.</p><p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I felt someone <i>touch</i> me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Like a hand on your shoulder or something?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; she whispered, her eyes large and frightened. &#x201c;Like someone touched me <i>inappropriately</i>.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Ah,&#x201d; I said with a nod. Now I knew who the aggressor was. &#x201c;Okay, if you&#x2019;ll unlock the door I&#x2019;ll get to work.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Can you really help us, M.J.?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what I do, Cassandra,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m a ghostbuster. Give me a few hours and let me see what I can do.&#x201d;</p><p>Cassandra followed me up the six steps to the front door and unlocked it for me. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll be all right in there by yourself?&#x201d; she asked, her face suddenly worried.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be fine,&#x201d; I said confidently. I&#x2019;d faced scarier stuff than this before. Pausing as the door swung shut behind me, I moved into the foyer and, looked around, setting my duffel bag down in the corner by the staircase. I wanted to get the lay of things before reaching into my bag of tricks.</p><p>I let my eyes travel around the room, getting a feel for the brownstone&#x2019;s configuration. The front foyer had several doorways leading to the rest of the house. To my right a corridor led to the kitchen. The living room was directly in front of me, and off to my left was what looked like a study. From my back pocket I pulled out my electrostatic meter, a small gadget that measures variances in electrostatic energy. I held my arm out and waved it in a circle around the foyer, noting the thick, luxurious carpet, high ceilings, crown molding, and expensive wall covering. The digs were definitely opulent, and even without furniture you could tell this place oozed money. And, according to my electrostatic meter, the place oozed something else, too.</p><p>With an eye on the needle bouncing back and forth across the gauge, I moved ahead through the foyer and into the living room. The needle gave a jolt as I edged over to the French doors that swung out onto the terrace. The needle bounced again. I put the little gadget in the back pocket of my jeans and closed my eyes for a moment and got myself centered.</p><p>Before I was a ghostbuster, I was a professional medium, which has proven to be the most beneficial skill for my success rate as a top-notch buster. In other words, I can sense energies that both have crossed over to the other side successfully, and those that have become stuck, or &#x201c;grounded,&#x201d; as we like to call it. In 84 Dartmouth I had immediately picked up the energies of two grounded spirits, one female and one male. I decided to focus on the female first.</p><p>Moving away from the French doors, I followed the small tug in my solar plexus, heading through the hallway and up the stairs. As I closed in on the female energy, something slightly disturbing happened. I felt the male energy, which was thick with ill will, begin to follow me. &#x201c;Back off a little, pal,&#x201d; I said quietly to him. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll deal with you in a moment.&#x201d;</p><p>The male energy didn&#x2019;t want to listen, but continued to shadow me up to the second floor, where I paused on the landing before continuing up to the third floor. There, at the end of the hallway, I saw a dark shadow dart into one of the bedrooms. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay,&#x201d; I said to the shadow. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not going to hurt you.&#x201d; I walked down the hall and into the bedroom, and noticed an immediate dip in temperature. I crossed my arms and shivered slightly, feeling the icy coolness penetrate my clothing and my skin, seeping into my bones. I&#x2019;d never gotten used to the deep chill that comes with rubbing up against spectral activity, but I pushed my discomfort aside and focused hard on the task at hand. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s your name, sweetheart?&#x201d; I asked the empty bedroom softly.</p><p>There was no response, but I could feel the fear emanating from the woman&#x2019;s spirit. I sensed her in the corner of the room, and sure enough, my mind&#x2019;s eye flashed an image of a young woman in her early twenties, crouched and cowering by the window. I moved over to that area and felt the temperature dip even lower. I knelt down and closed my eyes to concentrate. I said aloud, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m here to help you. He can&#x2019;t hurt you anymore, honey. And I&#x2019;ll make sure he doesn&#x2019;t get away with what he&#x2019;s done. Please talk to me. Tell me your name.&#x201d;</p><p>With relief I felt the name Carolyn float into my mind. I smiled sadly. The poor thing&#x2014;not only had she been raped and killed by the beast behind me, but now she was stuck in a confusing state of limbo. <i>Where are my parents?</i> she asked me desperately.</p><p>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re safe, but they&#x2019;re very worried about you, Carolyn. They&#x2019;ve asked me to help you. Will you allow me to?&#x201d;</p><p>I opened my eyes and stared at the blank space in front of me. I couldn&#x2019;t see Carolyn, but I could definitely feel and hear her. She didn&#x2019;t answer me right away, so I continued...</p></p><h2>Gulliver&#x2019;s Travels (Collins Classics)</h2><p><p>HarperCollins is proud to present its new range of best-loved, essential classics.</p><p>'I cannot but conclude the bulk of your natives to be the most pernicious race of little odious vermin that nature ever suffered to crawl upon the surface of the earth.'</p><p>Shipwrecked on the high seas, Lemuel Gulliver finds himself washed up on the strange island of Lilliput, a land inhabited by quarrelsome miniature people. On his travels he continues to meet others who force him to reflect on human behaviour - the giants of Brobdingnag, the Houyhnhnms and the Yahoos. In this scathing satire on the politics and morals of the 18th Century, Swift's condemnation of society and its institutions still resonates today.</p></p><p>This book is perfect for AP classes and is often selected for inclusion on the AP exam. The notes, reading pointers, and vocabulary in this addition will also help students at a lower reading level get the most out of these classics.Considered one of English literature's first and greatest satirists, Jonathan Swift possessed a timeless genius for pointing out the foibles of human nature that still has the power to provoke, amuse, and, at times, even outrage <br>our modern sensibilities. This representative collection of Swift's major writings includes the complete "Gulliver's Travels as well as "A Tale of a Tub, "The Battle of the Books," "A Modest Proposal," "An Argument Against Abolishing Christianity," "The Bickerstaff Papers," and many more of his brilliantly satirical works. Here too are selections from Swift's poetry and portions of his Journal to Stella.

Every year, teams of hundreds of competitors scramble over four days to complete roughly 350 challenges. The tasks range from moments of silliness to 1,000-mile road trips, and they call on participants to fully embrace the absurd. For students it is a rite of passage, and for the surrounding community it is a chance to glimpse the lighter side of a notoriously serious university.<br> <br> <i>We Made Uranium!</i> shares the stories behind Scav, told by participants and judges from the hunt&#x2019;s more than thirty-year history. The twenty-three essays range from the shockingly successful (a genuine, if minuscule, nuclear reaction created in a dorm room) to the endearing failures (it&#x2019;s hard to build a carwash for a train), and all the chicken hypnotisms and permanent tattoos in between. Taken together, they show how a scavenger hunt once meant for blowing off steam before finals has grown into one of the most outrageous annual traditions at any university. The tales told here are absurd, uplifting, hilarious, and thought-provoking&#x2014;and they are all one hundred percent true.</p></p><p><b>Leila Sales</b> is a graduate of the University of Chicago and former Scav participant and judge.

Mandis&#x2019;s nuanced and convincing analysis reveals the key forces that we all need to worry about when it comes to banking or any sector that&#x2019;s so important to the health of the economy: conflict of interest, self-dealing, and excess risk-taking.&#x201d;<br></p><h2>Let&#39;s See: Writings on Art from</h2><p><p><strong>Seventy-five of Peter Schjeldahl's engaging pieces on art from <em>The New Yorker</em>, published together for the first time.</strong></p> Distinguished critic at <em>The New Yorker</em> since 1998, Peter Schjeldahl has been described as America's most influential writer on art. Blessed with an unerring eye, he tackles a myriad of subjects with wit, poetry, and perspicacity, examining and questioning the art before him while reveling in the power and beauty of language. His writing springs from a desire to be understood by all readers, and a determination to help them engage with art of every kind.<br><br> Covering subjects drawn from a broad canvas of the history of art&#x2015;from ancient Greece, Mexico, and Byzantium, through Raphael, Rubens, and Rembrandt, to Bruce Nauman, Jean-Michel Basquiat, and John Currin&#x2015;the writings collected here seek out with precision and economy the essence of the individual artist or work under discussion, but they never lose sight of the bigger picture: What is beauty? What does it mean to be an American artist? What can the art we produce and admire tell us about ourselves?<br><br> With an imaginative introduction&#x2015;twenty questions, each one posed to Schjeldahl by a different artist or writer&#x2015;this collection will appeal to anyone who considers the experience of art, and of writing on art, an invitation to a voyage.<br><br> Coverage includes:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;� large-scale exhibitions at leading institutions around the world<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;� shows at private galleries<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;� profiles of prominent members of the art world<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;� personal accounts of time spent with artists<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;� the influences of museum spaces on our experience of art</p><p>Peter Schjeldahl is the author of numerous books of poems and criticism and has taught at Harvard University. He lives in New York.In 75 exuberant essays written for the <i>New Yorker</i> during the past 10 years, art critic Schjeldahl covers works from antiquity to the present. Many of his longtime favorite artists, including Fra Angelico, Manet, Eakins, Calder and Brice Marden, come in for praise. But one of Schjeldahl's virtues is that he can change his mind, as he does in enthusiastic reappraisals of Tintoretto, Chardin, Winslow Homer, John Currin and Christo's <i>The Gates</i>. He scolds connoisseurs who turn up their noses at shows like the Guggenheim's 1900: Art at the Crossroads, which consisted of paintings that were too popular for sober-sided intellectuals. In Varieties of Museum Experience, he offers a trenchant critique of various types of museums and praises Munich's new Pinakothek der Moderne, which offers a treat rather than a treatment. Controversy, like that surrounding the 1999 show Sensation at the Brooklyn Museum, delights him, and he is not afraid to be charmed by art that is out of fashion, such as the Victorian Fairy Painting exhibit at the Frick in 1998. We need to recover the pleasure principle in our experience of art and in our public talk about it, Schjeldahl says. <i>(May 27)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Emily Dickinson had a great love of birds&#x2015;in her collected poems, birds are mentioned 222 times, sometimes as the core inspiration of the poem. However, in existing anthologies of Dickinson's work, little acknowledgment is made of her close connection to birds. This book contains thirty-seven of Dickinson's poems featuring birds common to New England. Many lesser-known poems are brought to light, renewing our appreciation for Dickinson's work. <br><br>The editors' introduction draws extensively from Dickinson's letters, providing fascinating insights into her relationship with birds. The illustrations, by late 18th century to early 20th century artists/ornithologists, are often so apt as to seem to have been created with the poems in mind. Included are beautiful watercolors by Mark Catesby, engravings of John James Audubon's paintings, illustrations by Alexander Wilson, chromo-lithographs by Robert Ridgway (curator of birds at the National Museum for some fifty years), paintings by Louis Agassiz Fuertes, and some of the earliest bird photographs by Cordelia Stanwood. The editors also discuss the development and growth of birding in the nineteenth century as well as the evolution of field guides and early conservation efforts. Brief biographies of the artists are included in an appendix. This book is an eloquent tribute to the special place held by birds in our lives and imaginations, and will make an ideal gift for both birders and poetry readers.</p><p>EMILY DICKINSON (1830&#x2013;;1886) was a major American poet who lived in Amherst, Massachusetts. JO MILES SCHUMAN is an avid birder and the author of Art from Many Hands, Multicultural Art Projects (1981, 2002) and lives in Phippsburg, Maine. JOANNA BAILEY HODGMAN has enjoyed a lifelong interest in reading and writing poetry. A retired English teacher, she lives in Rochester, New York."The poems, selected by Jo Miles Schuman and Joanna Bailey Hodgman, offer a sense of the poet's close connection to her avian friends. The satiny pages are a fine complement to the beauty of Dickinson's imagery and the precise renderings of the artists."&#x2015;Jan Gardner, <i>Boston Globe</i><p>"A Spicing of Birds is a beautifully and sensitively done volume, that offers us a living, breathing slice of the author, and a good start to a reading of the birds in Dickinson's words."&#x2015;Jonathan Skinner, <i>The Emily Dickinson Journal, Volume II, No. 11</i></p><p>"The poems, selected by Jo Miles Schuman and Joanna Bailey Hodgman, offer a sense of the poet's close connection to her avian friends. The satiny pages are a fine complement to the beauty of Dickinson's imagery and the precise renderings of the artists."&#x2015;Jan Gardner, <i>Boston Globe</i></p><p>"Imagine a stormy day and a cozy fire in a country home with time for a cup of tea or coffee and some quiet, thoughtful moments watching the birds at your feeder.

But in this playful yet profound reflection on awareness, the compelling voice of a contemporary woman reveals the happiness at the bottom of the laundry basket, the love in the kitchen sink, and the peace possible in one&#x2019;s own backyard. Follow Karen Maezen Miller through youthful ambition and self-absorption, beyond a broken marriage, and into the steady calm of a so-called ordinary life. In her hands, household chores and caregiving tasks become opportunities for self-examination, lessons in relationship, and liberating moments of selflessness. With attention, it&#x2019;s the little things &#x2014; even the unexpected, unpleasant, and unwanted things &#x2014; that count.</p><p>Karen Maezen Miller is an errant wife, delinquent mother, reluctant dog walker, and expert laundress, as well as a Zen Buddhist priest and teacher, or sensei, at the Hazy Moon Zen Center in Los Angeles. She offers retreats and workshops around the country.Miller (<i>Momma Zen</i>) uses daily household chores&#x2014;laundry, kitchen, yard&#x2014;to demonstrate timeless Buddhist principles. The skillful weaving of personal anecdotes, a few Zen terms, and acute insights&#x2014;sometimes addressing the reader directly&#x2014;distinguish this book from others in the genre. Miller, a Zen priest and student of the late Maezumi Roshi, argues for the faultless wisdom of following instructions when going about the mundane activities that form the substance of everyday life. Candid about some of the difficulties of her past, Miller stresses the importance of changing perceptions, which can lead to more beneficial outcomes for oneself and others: All practice is the practice of making a turn in a different direction. The book wears its Zen lightly; indeed, Miller skates over the years of study&#x2014;as well as the decision to become a priest&#x2014;that undoubtedly ground her current perspectives. By choosing to focus on the conclusions rather than the process of her Zen journey, Miller has tilted her writing more toward self-help/advice than spirituality/religion. This disarming book is full of deft and reassuring observations. <i>(May 7)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

But all is not well at his monastery, where the monks are trying to teach the children their prayers in time for a very important visit from the Bishop. Having tried everything, they turn to Giovanni -- but he doesn&#x2019;t know anything about teaching! Eventually, though, Brother Giovanni discovers how to use his gifts to offer the children the perfect motivation.<br><br> This vibrant book, which includes a historical note and free recipe, tells the fascinating story behind one of the world&#x2019;s most popular snacks.</p><p>Anna Egan Smucker has been writing children's books for over twenty years.

Amanda lives in England. Visit herwebsite at&nbsp;www.amandahall-illustration.com.K-Gr 2&#x2014; In this warmhearted story of invention, Brother Giovanni happily works in the monastery bakery, singing as he kneads his dough. Down the hall, all is not well in the classroom. The unruly children will not learn their prayers for the upcoming visit from the Bishop. The Abbot turns to the young and energetic monk for help. After several unsuccessful attempts to get through to the children, Brother Giovanni finally comes up with a solution. In the company of his orange tabby cat, the optimistic baker concocts a special treat, bread rolled and twisted into the shape of praying arms. He decides to call his creations pretiolas&#x2014;little rewards. Bringing a basket of the freshly baked rolls to class, he instructs the children to fold their arms over their chests in the shape of the pretiolas and pray. Eager to sample the baked goods, the children do as he asks and learn their prayers. Beginning with eye-catching endpapers that portray Brother Giovanni riding from the monastery to a hilltop village, the cheerful illustrations welcome readers into the monk's medieval world. Executed in pastel watercolor inks and gouache, each scene reflects the warmth and ebullience exuded by the kind baker. In the style of illuminated manuscripts, many of the pictures are framed with elegant, decorative borders. A reader's note explaining the historical background of the legend and a recipe for soft pretzels are appended. VERDICT Read this delectable tale with Eric Carle's Walter the Baker (S. &amp; S., 2014), another satisfying story of how the pretzel came to be.&#x2014;Linda L.

Chesterton, Vol. 7: The Ball and the Cross, Manalive, The Flying Inn</h2><p>This seventh volume of the&nbsp;<i>Collected works of G.K. Chesterton</i>&nbsp;brings together three of this most acclaimed works of fiction, with introduction and notes by Chesterton scholar Iain Benson. A must for serious fans of Chesterton, this features the same quality and sturdy binding as the other volumes in this series.</p><p><p><b>G. K. Chesterton</b>&nbsp;was one of the most beloved and prolific authors of the twentieth century. He wrote dozens of popular books on a variety of topics and thousands of essays. His works include&nbsp;<i>Orthodoxy</i>,<i>&nbsp;The Everlasting Man</i>,&nbsp;<i>The Man Who Was Thursday</i>, and the Father Brown mystery stories.</p>&#34;The Three Novels in this Volume are philosophical adventures designed to make us see life. Not simply to see life, but see it in a new and brighter light, to see it more abundantly. As one of the novels suggests, to be alive is not the same thing as being merely alive, in the same way that to have eyes is not the same thing as to see, and to have a mind is not the same thing as to understand.&#34;</p><h2>I Was a Rat!</h2><p>&#x201c;I Was a Rat!&#x201d; So insists a scruffy boy named Roger. Maybe it&#x2019;s true. But what is he now? A terrifying monster running wild in the sewers? <i>The Daily Scourge</i> is sure of it. A victim of &#x201c;Rodent Delusion&#x201d;? The hospital nurse says yes. A lucrative fairground freak? He is to Mr. Tapscrew. A champion wriggler and a budding thief? That&#x2019;s what Billy thinks. Or just an ordinary small boy, though a little ratty in his habits? Only three people believe this version of the story. And it may take a royal intervention&#x2014;and a bit of magic&#x2014;to convince the rest of the world.<br><br>Set against the backdrop of a Royal Wedding&#x2014;and a playful parody of the press, <i>I Was a Rat!</i> is a magical weaving of humor, fairy tale, and adventure.</p><p><blockquote><i> "Bless my soul!" said Bob. "Who are you?"<br> "I was a rat," said the little boy. </i></blockquote> When a grubby young pageboy knocks on the door of Bob the cobbler and Joan the washerwoman's house, the kindly couple hardly knows what to think. Could this delusional boy be the answer to their prayers for a little one of their own? And was he really once a rat? It seems so. He shreds his bedding, for example, and he chews his toast swiftly with his front teeth. He eats an entire pencil and bites his teacher. Despite the fact that he is a little ratty in his habits, the old couple grow quite fond of the young fellow.<p> In time, the word spreads that there's a rat-boy in town, news that intrigues everyone from the Royal Philosopher to the P.T. Barnum-inspired freak-peddler Oliver Tapscrew to a reporter from the local rag <i>The Daily Scourge</i>. As the harmless, well-meaning boy is transformed into "The Monster of the Sewers" through pure sensationalism and mass hysteria, Philip Pullman playfully satirizes the power of the press and society at large.</p><p> What does it mean to be human? In this often darkly comic Dickensian tale, rats start to look pretty good by comparison. But in a fairy-tale ending, Bob and Joan teach us that humans, corrupt as we are, can always take solace in toasted cheese, love, and good craftsmanship. Kevin Hawkes's black-and-white illustrations enliven the already vivacious adventure that, thanks to Pullman's ever lovely wordplay and sly satire, is every bit as enjoyable for adults as it is for young readers.

Ropes were hastily flung over tree limbs, and men were lynched without the benefit of a jury trial. Bundles of switches thrown on the porches of "loose" men and women by masked night riders served as a warning to "mend your ways."</p><p>In this action-filled saga of the notorious eight-year rampage, journalist Mary Hartman and historian Elmo Ingenthron (a direct descendant of a Bald Knobber) have produced the most comprehensive account ever written on the Bald Knobber era. They trace the vigilantism, dating from the border wars of the Civil War and the internal strife that plagued the southern Missouri-northern Arkansas area for 20 years afterward. Although the Bald Knobbers were active for only a short period, their reign of terror spawned a legacy of fear and hatred that only in recent years has begun to subside.<br>In this book, you will come face-to-face with the legendary leaders of this group. Mat Kinney, a giant of a man, helped found the Bald Knobbers and led them in building a grim reputation that spread like an Ozark brush fire. Seventeen-year-old Billy Walker, a hot-tempered youth, murdered two members of an innocent family. In a grisly scene, Walker, his father, and a third Bald Knobber swung from the gallows in the region's only triple hanging.</p><p>A scandalous tale indeed, Bald Knobbers is a must for history buffs, action-seekers, and enthusiasts of the American frontier era.</p><p></p></p><p><p>1989 Winner<br>Major Work Category Award Missouri Writers Guild</p><p>"The book provides excellent coverage of a shameful decade in Ozark history."<br>--The Book Report</p><p>"The most comprehensive account of the Bald Knobber era ever written."<br>--True West</p><p>"Has the sweep and drama of a major novel, with the power and authority of historical truth."<br>--Loren D.

It is a torch. Bill Ayers&#x2019; vision for a humane future is incendiary fire that incinerates old logics and illuminates new paths. If we do not end the violence of militarism, materialism, caging, dispossession, debt, want, ignorance, and global warming, our very survival is impossible. Read aloud."<br><b> Robin D. G. Kelley, author of <i>Freedom Dreams</i></b><br><br>"With the beautiful idealism of a young radical and the sage wisdom of an elder, Bill Ayers is making trouble again, and we should all be grateful. In <i>Demand the Impossible</i> Ayers troubles the waters of staid political practices, insisting that we close our eyes for a moment and think creatively about what a better world might look like, and then open our eyes wide and organize boldly to make that world a reality. This is an elegant and provocative manifesto for our time, one that honors the social justice organizing currently in motion."<br><b> Barbara Ransby, author of <i>Ella Baker and the Black Freedom Movement</i></b><br><br>"Bill Ayers has produced a portrait of two worlds. One is a dystopia, recognizable as the world in which we live, the other a world that capitalism describes as a fantasy---a world reconstructed around values that place the advancement of humanity and the sanctity of the planet above the accumulation of wealth and power. The two portraits stand in dramatic contrast and make <i>Demand the Impossible</i> both illuminating and compelling. This manifesto is radical less in its rhetoric than in its daring to actually go to the roots of the barbarism of the capitalist system. <i>Demand the Impossible</i> is to be read and then shared widely. It can serve as a motivator for those of us engaged in the long battle for justice and social transformation."<br><b> Bill Fletcher, Jr, author of <i>Solidarity Divided</i></b><br><br>"In his many years of practicing and theorizing pedagogy, Bill Ayers has proven himself a master teacher.

These are despondent times, and yet, as Bill muses - history can surprise us. In preparation for that surprise, Bill has written a smart and inspirational manifesto."<br><b> Vijay Prashad, author of <i>The Poorer Nations</i></b><br><br>"Bill Ayers&#x2019; <i>Demand the Impossible</i> is a strong shot of inspiration for anyone searching for deep social transformation. It is a heartfelt, upbeat manifesto in favor of activism as an antidote to despair. Chock-full of personal stories, real facts and concrete examples packaged in exquisite writing, <i>Demand the Impossible</i> will open your mind to possibilities you never thought existed. Ayers will get you off your seat and into the street, fist raised, heart full, reaching for the spectacular."<br><b> Medea Benjamin, co-founder of Code Pink and author of <i>Drone Warfare: Killing by Remote Control</i></b><br><br><i>Demand the Impossible</i> is just what the world needs right now, a manifesto that challenges us to imagine bigger, love harder, create more expansively, and struggle toward a liberatory future in spite of our deepest doubts. Bill Ayers wakes us up and shows us that even the most entrenched, most permanent-seeming institutions the military, the prison, the police, capitalism itself are no match for the creativity and determination of the universal family&#x201d; and the better angels of ourselves.&#x201d;<i> Demand the Impossible</i> is a call to abandon the illusory American Dream wholesale, and, in its place, to unleash our own collective, revolutionary dreams into the universe. I dare you to not be inspired by this book.<br><b> Maya Schenwar, editor of <i>Truthout</i> and author of <i>Locked Down, Locked Out</i></b><br><br>"This is a deeply refreshing book, reminding us of why the core principles of socialist and anarchist thought peace, justice, freedom, equality are grounded, not in utopian fantasy, but in the joyous work of the creative imagination in everyday life. In large ways (an end to the military-industrial complex and the U.S. prison system) and small (the rebirth of community and public life in neighborhoods) Ayers offers a program that is long on ideals and even longer on actually existing programs, groups, movements, and individuals working toward a humane future. By turns alarming in its realistic assessment of the madness and stupidity of the present global system, and inspiring in its down to earth proposals for alternative human futures, this is a must-read for discouraged progressives everywhere. It is a book that could be a clear and present danger to Western civilization as we know it and in the very best way."<br><b> W. J. T. Mitchell, editor of <i>Critical Inquiry</i> and author of <i>Seeing Through Race and Cloning Terror</i></b><br><br>"Every once in a while a book comes along that not only changes the way one thinks, but opens a new space for imagining and then acting to create a better world with commitment, courage, and a heightened sense of ethical and social responsibility. <i>Demand the Impossible</i> is one of those books, and it ranks right at the top of the list. Ayers has a gift he not only writes like a poet but he never fails to deal with rigorous and important ideas in an accessible and moving style. Touching on a range of issues extending from police violence and racism to ecological destruction, Ayers raises all the right questions and connects the dots that provide a tapestry for energizing the radical imagination. This may be one of the best books written in that tradition. Powerful, insightful, prodding, challenging, and most of all hopeful if you want to understand the problems facing a society tipping into the abyss of authoritarianism, this book is a must-read, a kind of master text for those of us figuring out how to change a world that seems at time beyond our reach."<br><b> Henry Giroux, author of <i>Theory and Resistance in Education</i> and <i>The Violence of Organized Forgetting</i></b><br><br>"<i>Demand The Impossible</i> provides the imperative we need now. As public consciousness and despair heighten in our various locales, we must be willing to engage lessons from the past and present while building a future that is reflective of our commitment to justice.&nbsp; If we're serious about this, we know there is no choice: all we got is US!"<br><b> David Stovall,&nbsp; author of <i>Born Out of Struggle</i></b><br><p>"<em>Demand the Impossible!</em> is an ambitious, manifesto-like work rooted in the realities of the contemporary USA. It is divided into eight sections, each of which address a major issue, such as health care, prisons, education and the military machine. Ayers adopts a common approach in each case: a swift, hard-hitting identification of a major problem, and then a detailed sketch of an alternative.

It informed him that he had been fired from his job. Eighteen other educators in the Ocean Hill&#x2013;Brownsville area of Brooklyn received similar letters that day. The dismissed educators were white. The local school board that fired them was predominantly African-American. The crisis that the firings provoked became the most racially divisive moment in the city in more than a century, sparking three teachers&#x2019; strikes and increasingly angry confrontations between black and white New Yorkers at bargaining tables, on picket lines, and in the streets.<br><br> This superb book revisits the Ocean Hill&#x2013;Brownsville crisis&#x2014;a watershed in modern New York City race relations.

His writing has appeared in <i>The New York Times </i>and elsewhere. He lives in Jersey City, New Jersey.</p>Stolen Figs<br>Part IGIMIGLIANOTHE ROAD TO GIMIGLIANOTHE DOORS of the train opened at Naples. Shrill announcements twittered over the station PA system, babies cried, people argued, and beyond the tracks cars honked amid the din of Vespas and motorcycles. The passengers getting off the train squeezed their way past those trying to get on. Train workers, passengers, and merchants communicated with one another as if yelling across bleachers at a football game. The smell of fried <i>zeppole</i> and calzone filled the station. Vendors selling ice cream, water, and wine appeared and roamed the aisles, knocking on the doors of first-class air-conditioned compartments. When no one looked up, they opened the Plexiglas doors themselves. They were followed by Gypsy women begging for change, musicians playing guitars and accordions, and packs of children--many with piercing green eyes.My father and I, who had boarded in Rome, watched as the mob of people squeezed their way down the aisles, looking for seats. We were finally on our way to Gimigliano, in Calabria, the homeland of my grandparents.I had been staying with my father in Perugia, where he wassculpting stone, during the month of July. I had heard so many stories about Calabria, where his parents had been poor farmers. I suggested that we visit their village, but he shrugged off the idea. "That was decades ago," he said. "Why go back to the past?""Why not?" I asked. "Anyway, what's so bad about the past?""Nothing," he said dismissively. Going back, I knew, would remind him of his mother, who had died the year before, and his father, who had died eight years earlier. My father pushed a hand through his full head of hair, a soft mixture of jet black and silver. "I don't even know if we have family there anymore. They've probably all died--or moved to Torino or Milan.""Well, why not find out? What's it gonna hurt?" I had already decided to go even if he didn't, but I knew the trip would be better--would feel more appropriate--if we went together. "I know you're at least a little curious. Anyway, look at it as the one time you'll be able to take this trip with your son."My father laughed. "Jesus, you're such a romantic." He, too, is a romantic, but he wouldn't give in just then. He wouldn't admit that he might enjoy it. He fits the Calabrese stereotype of being stubborn, or having a <i>testa dura</i>--a hard head. My parents had taken my sister and me to Italy several times before, but this would be the first trip we had made south of Rome.He looked at his watch. I knew what he was thinking. Our stomachs were on the same schedule."C'mon, let's get some dinner," he said. And with that, we walked to the trattoria up the street from the apartment we were renting.At fifty-five, my father was fit and strong. Although he's a head shorter than I am, everything about him is grand: his nose, his eyes, his smile. And he eats with purpose and intensity.By the time we finished dinner and a liter of wine, he had agreed to take a two-day trip south, returning to Perugia on Sunday. Two days seemed like no time. But it didn't really matter how long we stayed: I would finally see Calabria, and I would see it with my father.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>The compartments filled. New passengers greeted the old ones and, like next-door neighbors, fell into conversations about the weather--hot even for July--and the recent strike of railroad concession workers. I unbuttoned my shirt and leaned out the window, trying to find a breeze. A man in a light brown suit claimed a seat across from us and joined me at the open window. He turned and greeted me with an exhausted smile, his thick mustache glistening with sweat. The train coasted out of the station. The thunk of windows sliding open sounded throughout the car. Passengers flocked to the windows, letting their shirts fill with air.As the train, an express, left old Naples, the yellow and pink seventeenth-century buildings of the historic center gave way to shoddy, colorless Mussolini-era tenements, which then yielded to the cinder-block Soviet-style structures of the 1970s, whose facades crumbled beneath their sagging balconies, then to suburbs, the Bay of Naples opening up on the west. Blue-and-white fishing skiffs lined the shore, their nets spread out to dry. To the east, Vesuvius's gaping crater broke through the smog.This was Campania, and as the train continued south, I saw how the sirocco winds from Africa had dried the soil and left the bushes and trees scrubby and desiccated. Olive trees, fig trees, and grapevines--the only vegetation that can thrive there--lined the hills. The train passed villages and peasant farms, each smaller than the last. All the buildings were simple structures, painted pale yellow, olive green, or burnt red. All the shutters were closed, shading interiors that were most likely, in true Italian form, immaculately clean and organized.This was the gateway to the south, the passage to Calabria.Already I saw the difference. Campania's hills are not the rolling hills of Tuscany Absent are wide-eyed pink travelers with their sulking kids. Absent are streets congested with souvenir shops. Absent are packed tour buses. Absent are crowded museums with their endless lines. Absent are English ex-pats and their summer villas. Absent are bilingual waiters and shop ladies. Absent are tourist menus in fourteen languages.Within the train compartments and along the hallways, conversationsgrew comfortably loud; gestures became grander, more ebullient. An older woman (from Cosenza, Calabria, I found out) offered up nuts and fruits. A dapper Neapolitan pensioner talked local politics in a harsh dialect. The mustachioed man in the brown suit stood up to demonstrate the size of the fig trees in his backyard, his hands forming around each imaginary branch. The woman smiled and held up a white fig that she had picked from her sister's garden."My God," my father said as if to himself, "I've been all along here. I remember this." He eased back in his seat and stared out the window, mouth open. The right corner of his mouth turned up in a smile.I went to the <i>carrozza ristorante,</i> the dining car, to get us some bottled water. Outside the open windows, the train hugged the ocean, the slate-blue water crashing against the rocks and boulders. Occasionally the jagged coast receded to an alcove of sandy shores. The sunbathers on these secluded beaches, reachable only by boat, didn't even register the train speeding above, but only stared out to sea, past their anchored motorboats rocking gently on the waves."The water is so blue, so light that it appears gray," someone said to me in Sicilian.I turned to a deeply tanned man who shot me a smile almost as wide as his panama hat. The Sicilian version of a well-off, relaxed Florida retiree, he had unbuttoned his brightly patterned yellow-and-red batik shirt, exposing a bare chest the color of a ripe tomato; two thick gold chains, one with a pendant of a saint, broke the wall of red."So does the sky," I responded in Italian."The sky is gray," he said, turning to me with an indignant glare. "It's the factories." He waved with one hand; on each finger was a large gold ring, embedded with colored stones that sparkled in the light. His hand floated through the air, then sailed downward like an unfolded tissue."The factories?" I knew that there was little industry for hundreds of miles south of Naples; Calabria's economy was especially depressed."Yes," he said, squinting as if about to impart a secret. "Up in thenorth. Those Milanese destroy everything, they're almost like the Germans."Did you come from Naples?" he went on.I told him I planned to stop there on the way back. He rested his large, gentle hand on my shoulder. <i>"� una bella citt�,"</i> he said--it's a beautiful city--and told me that whenever he passes through Naples, if only for a few hours, he ducks into a restaurant called Mimi alle Ferrovie, a block away from the train station. He had just been there, in fact: grilled calamari, mussels in a marinara sauce, and white wine--wine so distinct, he insisted, that you can taste the ashy soil of Vesuvius, where the grapes are grown.<i>"Ma, io sono Palermitano,"</i> he said, making sure that I understood that as a Sicilian from Palermo, he knew what he was talking about. "The marinara could have been a bit spicier, but the mozzarella di bufala ... nowhere else can you find it so fresh!"He explained what he did in his spare time, which was mostly what he was doing now, traveling and talking with strangers.As the pensioner spoke, his <i>sh's</i> and <i>ch's</i> clicked between his tongue and teeth in the distinct, forceful Sicilian dialect, barely understandable to any Italian off the great island, much less anyone living north of Naples--let alone me, who had learned Italian growing up in Connecticut and Florida and going to college in New York. Confident that people would work to understand him, he made no effort to slow or regulate his speech.He glanced at his chunky gold watch and, as if he'd almost missed an appointment, announced, <i>"Allora,</i> it's time for a <i>caff�."</i> We walked back to the bar--he for his coffee, I for bottled water.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Four hours out of Naples, our train crept through a desolate station--no one waiting alongside the tracks, not a single station door open or a window cracked. A blue sign at the edge of the platform read TORTORA. We had entered Calabria. For the next two hours I gazed out the window, the sea to my right, and to my left, far on the horizon, the deep green foothills of Calabria's Sila massif, locally known as the Black Forest.The heat was suffocating, and I started feeling sleepy. As I was about to doze...</p><h2>Enter the Saint</h2><p><p>Simon Templar tangles with the notorious &#x201c;Snake&#x201d; Ganning, tracks down a stash of stolen jewels, and busts a drug-smuggling racket. He may not always stay on the right side of the law, but with his swashbuckling charm and Robin Hood morality, he is clearly on the side of the angels. </p></p><p><p>Leslie Charteris was born in Singapore on May 12th, 1907. With his mother and brother, he moved to England in 1919 and attended Rossall School in Lancashire before moving on to Cambridge University to study law. His studies there came to a halt when a publisher accepted his first novel. His third book, entitled <i>Meet the Tiger!</i>, was written when he was twenty years old and published in September 1928. It introduced the world to Simon Templar, aka the Saint.</p><p>He continued to write about the Saint until 1983 when the last book, <i>Salvage for the Saint</i>, was published. The books, which have been translated into over thirty languages, number nearly a hundred and have sold over 40 million copies around the world. They&#x2019;ve inspired, to date, fifteen feature films, three TV series, ten radio series, and a comic strip that was written by Charteris and syndicated around the world for over a decade. He enjoyed travelling but settled for long periods in Hollywood, Florida, and finally in Surrey, England. He was awarded the Cartier Diamond Dagger by the Crime Writers&#x2019; Association in 1992, in recognition of a lifetime of achievement. He died the following year.</p><p>To find out more about Leslie Charteris and his work, visit www.lesliecharteris.com.</p></p><h2>Our Death</h2><p><p>Long recognized as a poet of radiant fury, of lament, and of refusal, Sean Bonney is a modern-day Blake whose poetry reminds us what matters. <em>Our Death</em>, his latest and long awaited first US collection, is full of poems of militant despair that refuse any capitulation to the worldview of the enemy. These poems wander the hinterlands of our absolutely endangered cities, chart the aftermath of the collapse of the social movements of the early part of the decade, and pay homage to the Greek anarchist poet Katerina Gogou.</p></p><p><p>Sean Bonney's poetry has been translated into several languages. His works include <em>Letters Against the Firmament</em> (Enitharmon Press, 2015), <em>Four Letters, Four Comments</em> (Punch Press, 2012), and <em>Happiness (Poems After Rimbaud)</em> (Unkant, 2011). He is currently based in Berlin.</p><strong>"What Teargas is For"</strong><p></p> <p></p> <p>Cops, being neither human nor animal, do not dream. They don&#x2019;t need to, they&#x2019;ve got teargas. Don&#x2019;t expect me to justify that. I mean, you know as well as I do that cops have got access to the content of all of our dreams. And you probably also know that a fair amount of the planet&#x2019;s teargas is supplied by the Westminster Group. Their non-executive chairman, whatever that is, is a member of the household of, ahem, Charles Windsor. He probably thinks of teargas as being somehow related to the Cloud of Unknowing, and, in a sense, he&#x2019;s kind of right. You come to a very real understanding of the nature of things, both visible and invisible, by having your sensory system hijacked and turned against you by a meaningful dose of teargas. It is the anti-Rimbaud. The absolute regulation and administration of all the senses. I mean try it. Next time things are starting to kick off a little bit just go out on the street and run straight into the middle of the biggest cloud of teargas you can find. Bang. Sight. Taste. Smell. All the rest of them. All turned into confusion, loss of geographical certainty and, most importantly, pain. Don&#x2019;t freak out. In the centre of that pain is a small and silent point of absolute Unknowing. It is that Unknowing that the cops - and by extension Charles Windsor - call knowledge. They want it. They&#x2019;ve got scalpels if necessary but teargas is cleaner. Its not clear what they want it for but any epileptic or voyant or drug addict could tell you what it is. It&#x2019;s there in Blake. Christ, it&#x2019;s there in the sleeve-notes to <em>Metal Machine Music</em>. What&#x2019;s it mean? Who cares. It answers no questions. What does Charles Windsor want with us. The cops will not tell us what they don&#x2019;t know and what they think we know.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p></p><h2>Juvenile Corrections</h2><p>On any given day, there are over 100,000 youthful offenders held in a variety of residential placements, from community-based wilderness experience programs or group homes to high security facilities that are almost indistinguishable from prisons. In addition, thousands of juveniles are incarcerated in adult jails or prisons and some will serve the rest of their lives behind bars. Despite a 200-year history of holding juveniles in these settings, there is a gap in our knowledge about what actually occurs within these places. There are assaults, murders and suicides, as well as staff and resident misconduct, medical misadventures, unintentional injuries and mismanagement. On the other hand, there are thousands of hard-working, dedicated, and professional staff members in these facilities who enthusiastically work toward the rehabilitation of these young people. The contributors to this volume examine some of the key issues and trends within contemporary juvenile corrections, highlight promising rehabilitative practices, and identify the challenges of working with these youth.</p><p>Matthew O.

Unfortunately, Pietism today is often equated with a &#x201c;holier-than-thou&#x201d; spiritual attitude, religious legalism, or withdrawal from involvement in society.<br><br>In this book Roger Olson and Christian Collins Winn argue that classical, historical Pietism is an influential stream in evangelical Christianity and that it must be recovered as a resource for evangelical renewal. They challenge misconceptions of Pietism by describing the origins, development, and main themes of the historical movement and the spiritual-theological ethos stemming from it. The book also explores Pietism&#x2019;s influence on contemporary Christian theologians and spiritual leaders such as Richard Foster and Stanley Grenz.<br><br>Watch a 2015 interview with the authors of this book here:<br><br></p><p>Roger E.

For adults, children and fans of timeless animal stories.</p><p>Listening to Alan Bennett read <i>The Story of Doctor Dolittle</i> is the next best thing to borrowing someone's kindly British grandfather for a marathon round of bedtime stories. Bennett seems to have an unlimited supply of voices, accents, and inflections on the ready, which he calls upon to impart each of Doctor Dolittle's animal companions with a distinct personality and voice.<p> Bennett's reading of the classic children's book is deliciously whimsical. As the tale opens, Dr. John Dolittle is on the verge of the realization that he's just not much good as a people doctor--his earnings have dwindled to a paltry sixpence a year. He takes the advice of his creaky-voiced 183-year-old parrot, Polynesia, and learns animal languages. As an animal doctor, he's brilliant and soon finds himself and his animal friends sailing to Africa to treat an epidemic among monkeys. With no trouble at all, Doctor Dolittle cures the monkeys, but he and his menagerie become embroiled in one adventure after another. They narrowly escape sinking in their leaky ship, thanks to some stowaway rats with surprisingly cultured and well-bred diction, who alert the doctor just in time. The doctor and his friends later run afoul of the Barbary pirates, known to be "a bad lot," for whom Bennett devises a hilariously unidentifiable but thoroughly villainous accent. With the help of some fast-talking (and hungry) sharks, Doctor Dolittle "persuades" the pirates they'd be much better off as birdseed farmers.</p><p> The adventures are exciting, but not frightening. Bennett's reassuring voice and the fact that the doctor always forges a peaceful solution to each predicament make the recording appropriate for small children. Adults, too, will find the stories appealing and are certain to appreciate the understated social satire occasionally voiced by the perceptive animals. The reading is rounded out by delightful orchestral selections from Camille Saint-Sa�ns's "Carnival of the Animals," which signal the beginning and end of each tape side.

In addition to her five children, she has three chickens and sixty-four Pez dispensers.<br><br> Their previous book is <i>Mustaches for Maddie</i>.<br>Gr 5-7-Sixth grader Flint (aka Squint) is feverishly trying to finish making his comic book in order to enter it in the "Find a Comic Star" contest. Due to a genetic eye disease, keratoconus, he wears thick glasses and has double, sometimes triple or quadruple, vision. Flint, who lives with his grandparents, spends most of his time alone working on his comic book. When McKell, a new girl at school and part of the popular group, sits with him at lunch, he's wary at first, but she seems genuine. She invites him to take a hike after school and talks about her brother Danny's YouTube videos where he posts challenges asking people to push themselves and try new things. After Flint tears his cornea and has surgery, he sees better than he has in years, a cause for celebration until he sees his comic more clearly and realizes that it isn't as good as he thought. He quits drawing, but after Danny dies of heart disease, a consequence of having progeria, a disease where you prematurely age, he works with McKell to fulfill Danny's last challenge, a chance for them both to achieve their dreams. Flint and McKell are sympathetic protagonists with relatable concerns and issues. The challenges of middle school are leavened with humor through the "Middle School Rules" sprinkled throughout the story. The use of the comic book as a metaphor for Flint's experiences would have been more impactful if it had been shown as the actual comic rather than written as text. This small flaw aside, this is a moving story about friendship, loss, and seeing life from other people's point of view.

The media loves to report on millions, billions, and trillions, but frequently makes basic mistakes or presents such numbers in misleading ways. And misunderstanding numbers can have serious consequences, since they can deceive us in many of our most important decisions, including how to vote, what to buy, and whether to make a financial investment. In this short, accessible, enlightening, and entertaining book, leading computer scientist Brian Kernighan teaches anyone&#x2015;even diehard math-phobes&#x2015;how to demystify the numbers that assault us every day.</p><p>With examples drawn from a rich variety of sources, including journalism, advertising, and politics, Kernighan demonstrates how numbers can mislead and misrepresent. In chapters covering big numbers, units, dimensions, and more, he lays bare everything from deceptive graphs to speciously precise numbers. And he shows how anyone&#x2015;using a few basic ideas and lots of shortcuts&#x2015;can easily learn to recognize common mistakes, determine whether numbers are credible, and make their own sensible estimates when needed.</p><p>Giving you the simple tools you need to avoid being fooled by dubious numbers, <i>Millions, Billions, Zillions</i> is an essential survival guide for a world drowning in big&#x2015;and often bad&#x2015;data.</p></p><p><b>Brian W.

Further, few books, if any, discuss the differing ways Jews and Christians approach this common scripture, or how each group appropriates its teachings in divergent, conflicting, and often complex ways.<br><br>Related to this issue is the problem of how scholarly approaches to reading this literature often stand in stark contrast to popular and religious approaches.

A great introduction of beginning students for the Hebrew Bible.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x2014;Hindy Najman, Oriel and Laing Professor of the Interpretation of Holy Scripture, University of Oxford <br><br>&#x201c;One could hardly ask for a better introduction to the Hebrew Bible than what is provided here by two distinguished biblical scholars. Beautifully written, the book provides an overview, not just of the content of each biblical book but also of controversies, critical issues, differences between Hebrew and Greek versions, and a venture into the different ways that Jews and Christians appropriate the Bible in their ongoing traditions. It is both accessible and interesting, excellent as a classroom text but clear enough for anyone to benefit, whether in a group or engaged in individual study.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x2014;Patrick D.

With her characteristic wit, Gardam captures a moment in time for three young women on the cusp of adulthood. With keen perception the novel charts the course of this trio as they boldly face their uncertain futures.<br><br> It is Yorkshire, 1946. The end of the war has changed the world again, and<br> emboldened by this new dawning Hetty Fallows, Una Vane, and Lisolette Klein seize the opportunities with enthusiasm. Hetty, desperate to escape the grasp of her critical mother, books a solo holiday to the Lake District under the pretext of completing her Oxford summer coursework. Una, the daughter of a disconcertingly cheery hairdresser, entertains a romantically inclined young man from the wrong side of the tracks and the left-side of politics. Meanwhile, Lisolette Klein, the mysterious Jewish refugee from Germany, leaves the Quaker family who had rescued her, to test herself in London. Although strikingly different from one another, these young women share the common goal of adventure and release from their middle class surroundings through romance and education.<br><br>Gardam demonstrates her talent for creating fully realized characters in these venturesome, intelligent young women whose stories are told with delight and understanding. This reissue of <i>The Flight of the Maidens </i>will appeal to a wide range of adult and young adult readers.</p><p><b>Jane Gardam</b> is the only writer to have been twice awarded the Whitbread Prize for Best Novel of the Year. She is winner of the David Higham Prize, the Royal Society for Literature's Winifred Holtby Prize, the Katherine Mansfield Prize, and the Silver Pen Award from PEN. Her novels include: <i>God on&nbsp;the Rocks</i>, shortlisted for the Booker Prize; <i>Old Filth</i>, a finalist for the Orange Prize;&nbsp;<i>The Man in the Wooden Hat</i>, finalist for the <i>Los Angeles Times </i>Book prize, and&nbsp;<i>Last Friends</i>, finalist for the Folio Award. She lives in the south of England, near the sea.Here is a great vacation read but it's definitely not a throwaway. Prolific English novelist Gardam, Whitbread Award winner for both The Hollow Land and Queen of the Tambourine, has crafted a story through which readers can step into 1946 England. The war is over and the world is profoundly changed, though some of the old trappings remain, reminders of a faded past. Three Yorkshire girls of considerable intelligence but modest means have earned scholarships to universities in Cambridge and London; the novel is set during the summer before their departure for university. Hetty Fallowes decides "to be ruthless and positive and in charge of [her] own soul." She rebels against her quirky parents, especially her pious mother, who married her intellectual, grave-digging father for love and now regrets it. Plucky Una Vane's mother is using her dead father's office (he was a doctor) as a beauty parlor; Una develops leftist leanings and embarks on a romance with Ray, a boy of questionable background. Lieselotte Klein is a Jewish-German refugee who came to the village as a child to live with a Quaker family. At 17, she is suddenly sent to stay with a strange, elderly Jewish couple in London and finally, briefly, with distant relatives in California. All characters, major and minor, are superbly developed and convincing. The portrait of postwar England as conventions crumble and the country is rebuilt is terrific, drawn by a writer whose attention to detail recreates, lovingly and with bright flashes of wit, another time and place.

Ideal for all marriages of any length from newlyweds to those married 60 years - even those just thinking about getting married. Description: What Did You Expect?: Redeeming the Realities of Marriage. It won&#39;t take long for you to realize that your marriage hasn&#39;t escaped the reality of sin or the brokenness of the world. It&#39;s what you do next that will make all the difference in the world in the character and quality of your marriage. The key to marital unity and love is not romance, rather, it is worship. It is only when I worship God as Creator, Sovereign, and Savior that I will ever love as I should. Have you ever wondered why some couples reach a place of unity, love, and understanding in their marriages while other couples seem trapped in the same struggles year, after year, after year? The surrounding culture would lead us to believe that a marriage of unity, love, and understanding is rooted in romance. Scripture would rather say that a good marriage is the result of worship. Does this confuse you? Then, this marriage conference is for you. Learn how practical these insights are for the everyday issues and situations of a real marriage; and, learn the practical steps that will help couples know how to get from where they are, to where God wants them to be. The truth presented in these sessions is not always easy to hear but it is profoundly good. This is the DVD version of the live marriage conference with Paul Tripp What Did You Expect?: Redeeming the Realities of Marriage - recorded on 3 DVDs. There are ten 25 minute sessions. Includes a reproducible Discussion Guide and Leader s Guide - downloadable PDFs. Ideal for use by Small Groups, Sunday school, pre-marital counseling, or individual couples.</p><p>Paul Tripp is the president of Paul Tripp Ministries, a nonprofit organization, whose mission statement is Connecting the transforming power of Jesus Christ to everyday life.

Paul Tripp has been married for many years to Luella and they have four grown children.As a pastor I am always on the lookout for resources that embody both doctrinal precision and practical application. Paul Tripp is consistently faithful to both. This conference has been a blessing both to me and those I serve. Will our marriages be characterized by ministry or manipulation? Will my relationship with my spouse be an expression of worship to God or a casualty of idolatry? The truth presented in these sessions is not always easy to hear but it is profoundly good. --Todd Pruitt, Teaching Pastor, Church of the Saviour, Wayne, Pennsylvania<br><br>In troubled times, God s truth deserves a clear voice characterized by uncompromising truth and passionate grace. Paul s conference presents just that: a clear challenge to examine our hearts based on the Gospel, and a compelling reminder of our own standing in grace, which then pours out into our closest relationships. Thanks to God for His gracious work in Paul s life and ministry to others desiring to connect the truths of the gospel to daily life. --Michael Boys, Lead Pastor, Bethel Church of Houston<br><br>Paul Tripp s ministry to our church through the marriage conference, What Did You Expect?: Redeeming the Realities of Marriage was pure grace. We give thanks for Paul's insightful biblical approach to understanding the essential issues in marriage as well as his humorous and realistic approach to married life. The conference accomplished all that we hoped for by helping our couples center their marriages around the gospel of grace. --Todd Augustine, Pastor of Congregational Life, College Church, Wheaton, Illinois</p><h2>The Song of the Jade Lily: A Novel</h2><p><p><strong>&#x201c;Kirsty Manning weaves together little-known threads of World War II history, family secrets, the past and the present into a page-turning, beautiful novel."&#x2014;&nbsp;Heather Morris, #1 <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author of <em>The Tattooist of Auschwitz</em></strong></p><p>A&nbsp;gripping historical novel that tells the little-known story of Jewish refugees who fled to Shanghai during WWII.</p><p><strong><em>1939</em></strong>: Two young girls meet in Shanghai, also known as the &#x201c;Paris of the East&#x201d;.

The Question of Birth Order<br></b><br>Elspeth Harmony&#x2019;s triplets arrived in the order that was to dog them for the rest of their lives: first, second, and third. They could not do otherwise, of course, but this was to determine so much for the three boys: emotional development, confidence, academic achievement, marriage, and ultimately &#x2013; with that extraordinary synchronicity that nature can sometimes muster &#x2013; the leaving of this world. Had the hospital not noted their order of appearance, and recorded it on the tiny bracelets fixed round the ankle of each by a nurse, then it would have been chance, rather than seniority, that governed how they fared in relation to one another. But these bracelets were put on, and the die, so to speak, was cast.<br><br>Matthew had some inkling about the significance of birth order within a family. As an only child, he had no sibling with whom to develop rivalries and other passions, but he knew so many who did. One friend, the youngest of five boys, had once opened up to him in a maudlin moment in the Cumberland Bar. &#x201c;They&#x2019;ve never taken me seriously,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Never. And everything I had at home &#x2013; everything &#x2013; was fifthhand. Fifthhand clothes, shoes, handkerchiefs &#x2013; the lot.&#x201d;<br><br>Matthew thought about this for a moment. &#x201c;Fourth,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>His friend, absorbed in self-pity, had said, rather peevishly, &#x201c;Fourth? Fourth what?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Hand,&#x201d; said Matthew. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s been through four hands by the time it reaches the fifth child. Therefore &#x2013; fourthhand.&#x201d;<br><br>Self-pity does not appreciate pedantry. &#x201c;Fifth,&#x201d; said Matthew&#x2019;s friend. &#x201c;Five owners &#x2013; fifthhand.&#x201d;<br><br>Matthew had stuck to his guns. &#x201c;No. It depends on the number of hands it has been through. And something that&#x2019;s secondhand has been through two sets of hands: the original owner&#x2019;s and the new owner&#x2019;s.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That means you have to count the fifth owner too,&#x201d; said the friend. &#x201c;My clothes were fifthhand. Five owners, including me.&#x201d;<br><br>Matthew had lost the point. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re probably right. But anyway . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, it was awful, I can tell you. And it&#x2019;s carried on all my life. Do you know my oldest brother? You&#x2019;ve met him, haven&#x2019;t you? He still treats me as if I&#x2019;m six. He expresses surprise if he phones and my wife says I&#x2019;m in the pub. He thinks I&#x2019;m not old enough. He still thinks that.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It could be worse,&#x201d; said Matthew. &#x201c;You could have no siblings &#x2013; like me. Nobody to compete with. Nobody to think you&#x2019;re too young. Nobody to dilute parental attention.&#x201d;<br><br>He was determined, of course, that he and Elspeth should make as few mistakes as possible in bringing up their triplets. A whole library of books had been purchased &#x2013; each claiming to be the definitive guide to the raising of infants and young children. They had gone to a special talk put on for the parents of twins &#x2013; prospective multiples had been the term used &#x2013; and had listened intently to the advice that one should seek to achieve a balance between economy of scale and recognition of individuality.<br><br>&#x201c;Your twin is a person, and not just a twin,&#x201d; said the lecturer. &#x201c;I call this the paradox of the shared self. We are all ourselves, but we are, at the same time, something other than an isolated self. We are a social self &#x2013; a self defined by those with whom we live; a self that has imposed upon it a number of roles &#x2013; the role of sibling, the role of child, the role of lover, the role of employee and so on. The self has so many facets.&#x201d;<br><br>This required further thought. More immediate were the various questions raised by those attending, among them that of the effect on the child himself or herself of being a twin or, as the questioner somewhat untactfully put it, worse. This led to a discussion of the usual behavioural issues, and, significantly, to the issue of birth order.<br><br>&#x201c;The experience of the multiple is different from other children,&#x201d; explained the lecturer. &#x201c;The twin or triplet does not have to deal with existing rights &#x2013; unless there are already older brothers and sisters. So there will not be a brother or sister who can do things better, who has an established position in the family: the playing field is level in that sense. Unless, of course, you tell the children who is oldest. And, frankly, I don&#x2019;t recommend that. Why create any sense of entitlement?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;My father was a twin,&#x201d; whispered Elspeth. &#x201c;He knew that he was younger than his brother. By a couple of minutes, apparently.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why did they tell him?&#x201d; asked Matthew.<br><br>&#x201c;They must have told them when they were very young. He said that he always knew.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We won&#x2019;t tell,&#x201d; said Matthew. &#x201c;We don&#x2019;t want to create any sense of entitlement, do we?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d;<br><br>They might not have wanted to, and yet they did. Five years later, in the face of persistent questioning, the parental position on birth order began to change and the official position that all three boys had been born at exactly the same time began to change. Yes, it was conceded, one had arrived first, but they claimed that they had forgotten who it was. That satisfied curiosity for a year or two, but the questions returned, and with the same determination as Mr. Tam Dalyell had shown in trying to winkle admissions out of Mrs. Thatcher on the sinking of the Belgrano, the boys managed to find out who was the oldest and who was the youngest. And so the fateful work was done, and the lottery of birth began to make its effects felt.<br><br>The first to be born was Rognvald, named after the Norse founder of the Earldom of Orkney, Matthew being Orcadian on his grandmother&#x2019;s side. The tiny baby, so small to be burdened with so great a name, was taken from his mother&#x2019;s arms, swaddled in a cloth, and given to his father, who wept with pride, with joy, as he looked down into the puckered little face. &#x201c;Rognvald,&#x201d; he muttered. &#x201c;Hello, my darling.&#x201d;<br><br>So moved was Matthew by this encounter that he quite forgot that Elspeth, still in the travails of labour, had two more babies to bring into the world. Matthew wanted to play with Rognvald, and had he brought with him to the hospital a Hornby Dublo train set &#x2013; as some excessively keen fathers have been known to do &#x2013; he would no doubt have set it up there and then and introduced his son to the pleasure of model railways. But all too soon, the nurse who had handed him Rognvald asked for him back. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve got another one now,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Look.&#x201d;<br><br>Matthew spent a moment placing the nurse&#x2019;s accent. It had a touch of the Hebrides to it &#x2013; Stornoway, perhaps. He said, &#x201c;Where are you from?&#x201d;<br><br>She said, &#x201c;Mull. Tobermory.&#x201d;<br><br>He was filled with gratitude. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll call the next one Tobermory,&#x201d; said Matthew. &#x201c;As a thank you.&#x201d;<br><b><br>2. The Naming of Boys</b><br><br>Tobermory&#x2019;s tiny lungs, once filled with air, lost no time in expelling it in the form of a cry of protest. If birth &#x2013; our first eviction &#x2013; is a deeply unsettling trauma, and we are told by those who claim to remember it that it is, then this child was not going to let the experience go unremarked upon. Red with rage, he vented his anger as Matthew cradled him. &#x201c;Hush, Tobermory,&#x201d; the new father crooned. &#x201c;Hush, hush.&#x201d;<br><br>On her pillow of pain, already exhausted by the effort of giving birth to two boys, Elspeth half-turned her head. &#x201c;Tobermory?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Just a working title,&#x201d; said Matthew, above the sound of Tobermory&#x2019;s screams. &#x201c;It suits him, don&#x2019;t you think?&#x201d;<br><br>Elspeth nodded wearily. They had agreed in advance upon the name Rognvald, and had more or less decided on Angus and Fergus for the others, but Elspeth, being wary of having children who rhymed, was less enthusiastic about these last two names. Tobermory sounded rather attractive to her; she had been there once, on a boat from Oban, and had loved the brightly painted line of houses that followed the curve of the bay. Why were Scottish buildings grey, when they could be pink, blue, ochre? Moray Place, where they lived, could be transformed if only they would paint it that pink that one finds in houses in Suffolk, or the warm sienna of one or two buildings in East Lothian.<br><br>&#x201c;Tobermory,&#x201d; she muttered. &#x201c;Yes, I rather like that.&#x201d;<br><br>She returned to the task at hand, and a few minutes later gave birth to Fergus, who was markedly more silent than Tobermory, at whom he appeared to look reproachfully, as if censuring him for creating such a fuss.<br>&nbsp;<br>The family of five was now complete. Matthew stayed in the hospital for a further hour, comforting Elspeth, who had become a bit weepy. Then, blowing a proud kiss to his three sons, he went back to the flat in Moray Place that the couple had moved into on the sale of their first matrimonial home in India Street. Once back, Matthew made his telephone calls &#x2013; to his father, to Elspeth&#x2019;s mother in Comrie, and to a list of more distant relatives whom he had promised to keep informed.<br><br>Then there were friends to contact, including Big Lou, who had been touchingly concerned over Elspeth&#x2019;s condition during her pregnancy.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re going to have to be really strong, Matthew,&#x201d; she warned. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not an easy thing for a lass to have triplets. You have to be there for her.&#x201d;<br><br>You have to be there for her. Matthew had not expected that expression from Big Lou, whose turn of phrase reflected rural Angus rather than the psychobabble-speaking hills of California.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be there for her, Lou,&#x201d; he said, following her lead. &#x201c;In whatever space she&#x2019;s in, I&#x2019;ll be there.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Good,&#x201d; said Lou. &#x201c;She&#x2019;ll be fair trachled with three bairns. You too. You&#x2019;ll be trachled, Matthew. It&#x2019;s a sair fecht.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Aye,&#x201d; said Matthew, lapsing into Scots. &#x201c;I ken. I&#x2019;ll hae my haunds fu.&#x201d;<br><br>But now there was no word of caution from Big Lou. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re all right, are they, Matthew?&#x201d; she said over the telephone.<br><br>He assured her that they were, and she let out a whoop of delight. This show of spontaneous shared joy moved Matthew deeply. That another person should feel joy for him, should be proud when he felt proud, should share his heady, intoxicating elation, struck him as remarkable. Most people, he suspected, did not want others to be happy, not deep down. However we pretended otherwise, we resented the success of our friends; not that we did not want them to meet with success at all &#x2013; it&#x2019;s just that we did not want them to be markedly more successful than we were. Matthew remembered reading somewhere that somebody had written &#x2013; waspishly, but truly &#x2013; every time a friend succeeds, I die a little. Gore Vidal: yes, he had said it. The problem, though, with witty people, thought Matthew, was working out whether they meant what they said.<br><br>And it was the same with money. If somebody knew you had money &#x2013; and Matthew had, when all was said and done, slightly more than four million pounds, transferred to him by his father &#x2013; if a friend knew that sort of thing, then his face would cloud over, just for a moment, as the emotion of envy registered itself. We do not want our friends to be poor, but by and large we prefer them to be slightly poorer than we are &#x2013; just a fraction.<br><br>Big Lou meant what she said. She was delighted that Elspeth and the triplets were well; she was thrilled that Matthew was so happy; she was, moreover, very pleased that the population of Scotland had gone up by three at a time when demographic trends pointed the other way.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to celebrate,&#x201d; she said to Matthew. <br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s great, Lou. How?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll work something out,&#x201d; she said. <br><br>Matthew realised that his enquiry had been tactless. Big Lou lived on her own, and the thought of her celebrating by herself, opening a bottle of wine, perhaps, in her flat in Canonmills and then drinking a toast that would be echoed by nobody else, saddened him. Life could be a lonely affair, and there was no justice in allocation of company. There were many selfish and unmeritorious people who were surrounded by more friends than they could manage; there were many good and generous people who were alone, who would love to have somebody to go home to, but who did not.<br><br>Big Lou was one of those. Matthew had met some of her male friends, and had taken a thorough dislike to them. There was that cook who had gone off to Mobile, Alabama, and who had shown excessive interest in young waitresses &#x2013; Matthew had not liked him at all. Then there had been the Jacobite plasterer, who had gone on about the Stuarts and their restoration and who had, in Matthew&#x2019;s view, been certifiably insane. No, Big Lou had not had the luck she deserved, but could anything be done about it? Should she wait until some man wandered into her life &#x2013; if that was ever going to happen &#x2013; or should her friends perhaps speak to her about a dating agency? Why not? Dating agencies worked &#x2013; sometimes &#x2013; and Matthew had read of one that allowed you to get as many men as you liked &#x2013; seriatim, of course &#x2013; for three hundred and fifty pounds. Matthew had three hundred and fifty pounds; perhaps he would speak to Big Lou &#x2013; tactfully of course. Big Lou came from Arbroath, and people who came from Arbroath were fine people in so many ways, but could be unexpectedly touchy-touchy, not touchy-feely.</p><h2>Proving History: Bayes&#39;s Theorem and the Quest for the Historical Jesus</h2><p>This in-depth discussion of New Testament scholarship and the challenges of history as a whole proposes Bayes&#39;s Theorem, which deals with probabilities under conditions of uncertainty, as a solution to the problem of establishing reliable historical criteria. The author demonstrates that valid historical methods-not only in the study of Christian origins but in any historical study-can be described by, and reduced to, the logic of Bayes&#39;s Theorem. Conversely, he argues that any method that cannot be reduced to this theorem is invalid and should be abandoned. Writing with thoroughness and clarity, the author explains Bayes&#39;s Theorem in terms that are easily understandable to professional historians and laypeople alike, employing nothing more than well-known primary school math. He then explores precisely how the theorem can be applied to history and addresses numerous challenges to and criticisms of its use in testing or justifying the conclusions that historians make about the important persons and events of the past. The traditional and established methods of historians are analyzed using the theorem, as well as all the major &#34;historicity criteria&#34; employed in the latest quest to establish the historicity of Jesus. The author demonstrates not only the deficiencies of these approaches but also ways to rehabilitate them using Bayes&#39;s Theorem. Anyone with an interest in historical methods, how historical knowledge can be justified, new applications of Bayes&#39;s Theorem, or the study of the historical Jesus will find this book to be essential reading.</p><p><b>Richard C.

This is not the Torah as it is known in conventional terms; it something far more mysterious&#x2014;something pre-existent and pre-creation. The Primordial Torah does not come from some ancient time, and is not based on any historical texts; it is a teaching more primordial than the creation of the world, and thus not bound to the dimensions of time and space. This book is based on the first public presentation of the Kedumah Teaching&#x2014;the mystical path of the Primordial Torah. With clarity, humor, and erudition, Zvi Ish-Shalom guides us on an experiential journey back to our deepest nature, the non-conceptual ground of reality and primordial source of all wisdom teachings.</p><p>Zvi Ish-Shalom, Ph.D., is an Associate Professor of Wisdom Traditions at Naropa University in Boulder, Colorado, and is the founder and guiding teacher of the Kedumah Institute.

Because Zvi has had the capacity and merit to do the work required&nbsp;in order to qualify for direct knowledge that is independent of any&nbsp;intermediate authority and has an extremely high level of facility in all&nbsp;major aspects and stages of the Torah tradition, he can express a mode of&nbsp;Primordial Torah that is authentic yet really new.

He is English and was born in Manchester.Developed in tandem with a four-part PBS series to air in November, Evans's profusely illustrated and elegantly written book offers the same breadth and scope as his previous bestseller, <i>The American Century</i>. Evans, former president and publisher of Random House, profiles 70 of America's leading inventors, entrepreneurs and innovators, some better known than others. Along with such obvious choices as Henry Ford, Thomas Edison and the Wright brothers, Evans profiles Lewis Tappan (an abolitionist who dreamed up the idea of credit ratings), Gen. Georges Doriot (pioneer of venture capital) and Joan Ganz Cooney, of the Children's Television Workshop. From A.P. Giannini (father of consumer banking) to Ida Rosenthal (the Maidenform Bra tycoon), Evans shows innovation as both a product of and a contributor to the grand apparatus of American society. And his spotlight is on the true American elite: the aristocracy of strategic visionaries, creative risk takers and entrepreneurial adventurers thriving in their natural environment, the free-market democracy of the United States. Evans doesn't neglect the latest generation of innovators, among them Google's Larry Page and Sergey Brin. He concludes with a note of caution, pointing out the nation's recent loss of dominance in the hard sciences. But just as Edison was inspired by popular biographies of innovators before him, so might the next generation of scientific and commercial explorers find guidance in Evans's exciting survey. 500 color illus. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Carmel, the prophet Elijah s mountain-top place of encounter with divine power. In the Gospels, we frequently read that Jesus withdrew to quiet places to pray. These biblical precedents have inspired a tradition of contemplation through the centuries and this remarkable book reveals the life and teachings of the great spiritual teachers and Christian mystics, including St. John, Origen, St. Benedict, Julian of Norwich, St. John of the Cross, Meister Eckhart, and modern day mystics like Thomas Merton, Simone Weil, Etty Hillesum, Bede Griffiths, and John Main.

Within two years, twenty men and women are hanged or pressed to death and over a hundred others imprisoned and impoverished. In <i>The Salem Witch Trials Reader</i>, Frances Hill provides and astutely comments upon the actual documents from the trial--examinations of suspected witches, eyewitness accounts of "Satanic influence," as well as the testimony of those who retained their reason and defied the madness. Always drawing on firsthand documents, she illustrates the historical background to the witchhunt and shows how the trials have been represented, and sometimes distorted, by historians--and how they have fired the imaginations of poets, playwrights, and novelists. For those fascinated by the Salem witch trials, this is compelling reading and the sourcebook.</p></p><p><p>Frances Hill is an accomplished journalist and novelist whose previous book on the Salem witch trials, A Delusion of Satan, was called "carefully researched and compelling" by Karen Armstrong, the author of A History of God.

Here is the first book to recount how American women have gathered, cooked, and prepared food for lovers, strangers, and family throughout the ages. We find native women who pried nourishment from the wilderness, mothers who sold biscuits to buy their children's freedom, immigrant wives who cooked old foods in new homes to provide comfort. From church bake sales to microwaving moms, this book is a celebration of women's lives, homes, and communities. Over fifty recipes, from Federal Pancakes to Sweet Potato Pie, are beautifully presented along with over one hundred images from artists, photographers, and rare sources. <em>A Thousand Years Over a Hot Stove</em> is the shared history of all American women and the perfect gift for anyone who ever put food on the table. 140 illustrations</p><p>Laura Schenone is the author of the James Beard Award&#x2013;winning A Thousand Years Over a Hot Stove and The Lost Ravioli Recipes of Hoboken. She lives in New Jersey with her family and dog Lily.As the title implies, in her first book, freelance writer Schenone has attempted to cover more than a millennium in women's history, tossing in historically interesting recipes along the way. The results of this ambitious project, however, can't help but be broad, and the book is full of sweeping statements such as, "As cooks, Native American women lay the first claim to some of the greatest ingredients in the history of the world." A turgid introduction reaches even further back than 1,000 years to conjure a figure Schenone names "All Woman," whom she imagines as the first female on earth and imbues with all kinds of knowledge and curiosity. Later chapters are more fact-based and reliable. Indeed, when Schenone delves into the specific, her writing immediately improves. For example, a section in a chapter on the 19th century that details the development of urban peddlers and more specifically "hot corn women," is rich with description, evocative and offers information that is probably new to most readers. The author also does a commendable job of drawing the often-ignored connections among politics, women and food when describing events such as the 1917 food riots in New York City and lunch counter sit-ins in the 1960s. The book is chockablock with recipes (often for oddities such as Apple Crisp Pronto from 1943, a concoction of packaged bread, margarine, honey and apples meant to help Rosie the Riveter get dinner on the table), period illustrations and sidebars, including one on Sara Josepha Hale, who standardized the Thanksgiving holiday. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Happiness Is the Way: How to Reframe Your Thinking and Work with What You Already Have to Live the Life of Your Dreams</h2><p><b>The first book of spiritual teachings in several years from international best-selling author and beloved spiritual teacher Dr. Wayne W.

After several lean and striving years, he has his pick of both magazine assignments and women: Juliet, the hotshot business reporter; Elisa, his gorgeous ex-girlfriend, now friend; and Hannah, "almost universally regarded as nice and smart, or smart and nice," who holds her own in conversation with his friends.

She worked as a reporter at the New Haven Register and the Cleveland Plain Dealer, and wrote a column for the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>s website. Her articles also have appeared in <i>The New York Times Book Review, The New Republic, Slate, </i>and <i>The Wall Street Journal,</i> among other national publications. She lives in Brooklyn, New York.1 <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br>It was too late to pretend he hadn&#x2019;t seen her. Juliet was already squinting with recognition. For an instant she looked pleased to make out a familiar face on a crowded street. Then she realized who it was. <br>&#x201c;Nate.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Juliet! <i>Hi.</i> How <i>are</i> you?&#x201d; <br>At the sound of his voice, a tight little grimace passed over Juliet&#x2019;s eyes and mouth. Nate smiled uneasily. <br>&#x201c;You look terrific,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;How&#x2019;s the <i>Journal?</i>&#x201d; <br>Juliet shut her eyes briefly. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s fine, Nate. I&#x2019;m fine, the <i>Journal</i>&#x2019;s fine. Everything&#x2019;s fine.&#x201d; <br>She crossed her arms in front of her and began gazing meditatively at a point just above and to the left of his forehead. Her dark hair was loose, and she wore a belted blue dress and a black blazer whose sleeves were bunched up near her elbows. Nate glanced from Juliet to a cluster of passersby and back to Juliet. <br>&#x201c;Are you headed to the train?&#x201d; he asked, pointing with his chin to the subway entrance on the corner. <br>&#x201c; <i>Really?</i>&#x201d; Juliet&#x2019;s voice became throaty and animated. &#x201c;Really, Nate? That&#x2019;s all you have to say to me?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Jesus, Juliet!&#x201d; Nate took a small step back. &#x201c;I just thought you might be in a hurry.&#x201d; <br>In fact, he was worried about the time. He was already late to Elisa&#x2019;s dinner party. He touched a hand to his hair&#x2014;it always reassured him a little, the thick abundance of his hair. <br>&#x201c;Come on, Juliet,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;It doesn&#x2019;t have to be this way.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Oh?&#x201d; Juliet&#x2019;s posture grew rigid. &#x201c;How should it be, Nate?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Juliet&#x2014;&#x201d; he began. She cut him off. <br>&#x201c;You could have at least&#x2014;&#x201d; She shook her head. &#x201c;Oh, never mind. It&#x2019;s not worth it.&#x201d; <br>Could have at least what? Nate wanted to know. But he pictured Elisa&#x2019;s wounded, withering look if he showed up so late that all her guests had to wait on him to start dinner, heard her slightly nasal voice brushing off his apology with a &#x201c;whatever,&#x201d; as if she had long since ceased to be surprised by any new bad thing he did. <br>&#x201c;Look, Juliet, it was great to see you. And you do look great. But I&#x2019;ve really got to go.&#x201d; <br>Juliet&#x2019;s head jerked back. She seemed almost to wince. Nate could see&#x2014;it was obvious&#x2014;that she took his words as a rejection. Immediately, he was sorry. He saw her suddenly not as an adversary but as a vulnerable, unhappy young&#x2014;youngish&#x2014;woman. He wanted to do something for her, say something earnest and truthful and kind. <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re an asshole,&#x201d; she said before he had the chance. <br>She looked at him for a fraction of a second and then turned away, began walking quickly toward the river and the adjacent strip of restaurants and bars. Nate nearly called after her. He wanted to try, at least, to put things on a better footing. But what would he say? And there was no time. <br>Juliet&#x2019;s strides, as she receded into the distance, were long and determined, but she moved stiffly, like a person determined not to let on that her shoes hurt her feet. Reluctantly, Nate started walking in the opposite direction. In the deepening twilight, the packed street no longer seemed festive but seedy and carnival-like. He got stuck behind a trio of young women with sunglasses pushed up on their heads and purses flapping against their hips. As he maneuvered around them, the one closest twisted her wavy blonde hair around her neck and spoke to her companions in a Queen Bee&#x2013;ish twang. Her glance flickered in his direction. Nate didn&#x2019;t know if the disdain on her face was real or imagined. He felt conspicuous, as if Juliet&#x2019;s insult had marked him. <br>After a few blocks, the sidewalks became less congested. Nate began moving faster. And he began to feel irritated with himself for being so rattled. So Juliet didn&#x2019;t like him. So what? It wasn&#x2019;t as if she were being fair. <br>Could have at least <i>what</i>? He had only been out with her three or four times when it happened. <i>It</i> was no one&#x2019;s fault. As soon as he realized the condom had broken, he&#x2019;d pulled out. Not quite in time, it turned out. He knew that because he was not the kind of guy who disappeared after sleeping with a woman&#x2014;and certainly not after the condom broke. On the contrary: Nathaniel Piven was a product of a postfeminist, 1980s childhood and politically correct, 1990s college education. He had learned all about male privilege. Moreover he was in possession of a functional and frankly rather clamorous conscience. <br>Consider, though, what it had been for <i>him</i>. (Walking briskly now, Nate imagined he was defending himself before an audience.) The party line&#x2014;he told his listeners&#x2014;is that she, as the woman, had the worst of it. And she did, of course. But it wasn&#x2019;t a cakewalk for him, either. There he was, thirty years old, his career finally taking off&#x2014;an outcome that had not seemed at all inevitable, or even particularly likely, in his twenties&#x2014;when suddenly there erupted the question of whether he would become a father, which would obviously change everything. Yet it <i>was not in his hands</i>. It was in the hands of a person he barely knew, a woman whom, yes, he&#x2019;d slept with, but who was by no means his girlfriend. He felt like he had woken up in one of those after-school specials he watched as a kid on Thursday afternoons, whose moral was not to have sex with a girl unless you were ready to raise a child with her. This had always seemed like bullshit. What self-respecting middle-class teenage girl&#x2014;soon-to-be college student, future affluent young professional, a person who could go on to do anything at all (run a multinational corporation, win a Nobel Prize, get elected first woman president)&#x2014;what such young woman would decide to have a baby and thus become, in the vacuous, public service announcement jargon of the day, &#x201c;a statistic&#x201d;? <br>When Juliet broke the news, Nate realized how much had changed in the years since he&#x2019;d hashed this out. An already affluent, thirty-four-year-old professional like Juliet might view her situation differently than a teenager with nothing before her but possibility. Maybe she was no longer so optimistic about what fate held in store for her (first woman president, for example, probably seemed unlikely). Maybe she had become pessimistic about men and dating. She might view this as her last chance to become a mother. <br>Nate&#x2019;s future hinged on Juliet&#x2019;s decision, and yet not only was it not his to make, he couldn&#x2019;t even seem to be unduly influencing her. Talking to Juliet, sitting on the blue-and-white-striped sofa in her living room with a cup of tea&#x2014; <i>tea!</i>&#x2014;in his hand, discussing the &#x201c;situation,&#x201d; it seemed he&#x2019;d be branded a monster if he so much as implied that his preference was to abort the baby or fetus or whatever you wanted to call it. (Nate was all for a woman&#x2019;s right to choose and all the lingo that went with it.) He&#x2019;d sat there, and he&#x2019;d said the right things&#x2014;that it was her decision, that whatever she wanted he&#x2019;d support, et cetera, et cetera. But who could blame him if he felt only relief when she said&#x2014;in her &#x201c;I&#x2019;m a smart-ass, brook-no-bullshit newspaper reporter&#x201d; tone of voice&#x2014;that, obviously, abortion was the natural solution? Even then he didn&#x2019;t allow himself to show any emotion. He spoke in a deliberate and measured tone. He said that she should think hard about it. Who could blame him for any of it? <br>Well, she could. Obviously, she did. <br>A livery cab idled past, its driver eying Nate to see if he was a potential fare. Nate waved the car on. <br>As he crossed an empty street, he began to feel certain that what Juliet actually blamed him for was that his reaction, however decent, had made abundantly clear that he didn&#x2019;t want to be her boyfriend, let alone the father of her child. The whole thing was so <i>personal</i>. You were deciding whether you wanted to say yes to this potential person, literally a commingling of your two selves, or stamp out all trace of its existence. Of course it made you think about how different it would be if the circumstances were different&#x2014;especially, he imagined, if you were a woman and on some level you wanted a baby. Sitting in Juliet&#x2019;s living room, Nate had been surprised by just how awful he felt, how sad, how disgusted by the weak, wanton libidinousness (as it seemed to him then) that had brought him to this uncomfortable, dissembling place. <br>But did any of it make him an asshole? He had never promised her anything. He&#x2019;d met her at a party, found her attractive, liked her enough to want to get to know her better. He&#x2019;d been careful not to imply more than that. He&#x2019;d told her that he wasn&#x2019;t looking for anything serious, that he was focused on his career. She&#x2019;d nodded, agreed. Yet he felt sure the whole thing would have played out differently if he could have said to her, Look, Juliet, let&#x2019;s not have this baby, but maybe some other, at some future point&nbsp;&#x2026; But while he admired Juliet&#x2019;s sleek, no-nonsense demeanor, that brisk, confident air, he admired it with dispassionate fascination, as a fine example of type, rather than with warmth. In truth he found her a bit dull. <br>Nevertheless, he had done everything that could have been expected of him. Even though he had less money than she did, he paid for the abortion. He went with her to the clinic and waited while it was being performed, sitting on a stain-resistant, dormitory lounge&#x2013;style couch with a rotating cast of teenage girls who typed frenetically on their cell phones&#x2019; tiny keyboards. When it was over, he took her home in a taxi. They spent a pleasant, strangely companionable day together, at her place, watching movies and drinking wine. He left the apartment only to pick up her prescription and bring her a few groceries. When, finally, around nine, he got up to go home, she followed him to the door. <br>She looked at him intently. &#x201c;Today was&nbsp;&#x2026; well, it wasn&#x2019;t as bad as it could have been.&#x201d; <br>He, too, felt particularly tender at that moment. He brushed some hair from her cheek with his thumb and let it linger for a moment. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m really sorry for what you had to go through,&#x201d; he said. <br>A few days later, he called to see how she was feeling. <br>&#x201c;A little sore, but okay,&#x201d; she said. <br>He said he was glad to hear it. There was a long pause. Nate knew he should say something chatty and diverting. He opened his mouth to speak. But a panicky premonition came over him: this phone call would lead to an endless string of others, the day at Juliet&#x2019;s apartment to a regular movie date, all tinged with a sense of obligation and an almost creepy quasi flirtation. <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got to run,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m glad you&#x2019;re feeling better.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Oh.&#x201d; Juliet drew in her breath. &#x201c;Okay&nbsp;&#x2026; Bye, then.&#x201d; <br>He probably should have followed up after that. As he turned the corner onto Elisa&#x2019;s street, Nate conceded that he should have called or e-mailed a few weeks later. But, at the time, he hadn&#x2019;t known if a call from him would have been welcome. It might have been a painful reminder of something she would rather put behind her. Nor did he know what he would have said. And he&#x2019;d gotten distracted, caught up in other things&#x2014;in life. She could have called him. <br>He&#x2019;d done more than many guys would have. Was it his fault if he just didn&#x2019;t feel that way about her? <i>Could have at least what?</i> <br>The front door of Elisa&#x2019;s building was propped open with a large rock. Light from the hallway made a yellow arc on the concrete stoop. Nate paused before entering, taking a breath and running a hand through his hair. Inside, the stairs sagged and groaned under his feet. Elisa&#x2019;s landing smelled of saut�ed onions. After a moment, the door swung open. <br>&#x201c;Natty!&#x201d; she cried, throwing her arms around him. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>Though he and Elisa had broken up more than a year ago, her apartment, on the top floor of a row house in gentrifying Greenpoint, still felt almost as familiar to Nate as his own. <br>Before she moved in, its brick walls had been plastered over and covered with floral wallpaper. The thick, irregular beams of the wood floor were hidden under carpet. Elisa&#x2019;s landlord, Joe Jr., once showed Nate and Elisa photos. After more than twenty years, its elderly Polish occupant had left to live with a daughter in New Jersey. Joe Jr. had torn up the carpet and ripped the plaster off the exterior walls. His father, who had bought the house in the 1940s and had since moved to Florida, said he was crazy. Joe Sr. thought adding a dishwasher or replacing the old bathtub would have been a better investment. &#x201c;But I told him that that wasn&#x2019;t the way to attract high-class tenants,&#x201d; Joe Jr. explained to Nate and Elisa one afternoon, while he repaired some tiles in the bathroom. &#x201c;I told him the kind of people who pay the big bucks go wild for clawfoot tubs. It&#x2019;s a matter of taste, I told him.&#x201d; Joe Jr. turned to face them, a jar of spackle dangling from his fleshy fingers. &#x201c;And was I right or was I right?&#x201d; he asked jovially, a big grin lighting up his face. Nate and Elisa, holding hands, nodded uneasily, unsure of the appropriate response to being so openly&#x2014;and aptly&#x2014;characterized as a certain kind of dupe. <br>Nate had helped Elisa paint the two nonbrick walls a beige that contrasted with the dark brick and the cream-colored rug under her couch. The dining room table they had purchased together at Ikea, but the chairs and a long cabinet by the door had belonged to her grandparents. (Or was it her great-grandparents?) Her bookcases reached nearly to the ceiling. <br>The apartment&#x2019;s familiarity now felt to him like a reproach. Elisa had insisted on his presence tonight. &#x201c;If we really are friends, why can&#x2019;t I have you over for dinner with a few people?&#x201d; she&#x2019;d asked. What could he say? <br>On the couch, Nate&#x2019;s friend Jason, a magazine editor who, to Nate&#x2019;s alternating irritation and amusement, had long wanted to get into Elisa&#x2019;s pants, leaned back regally, cradling the back of his head in his palms. Jason&#x2019;s knees were stretched absurdly far apart, as if he were trying to bore the largest possible impression of himself into Elisa&#x2019;s furniture. Next to Jason sat Aurit, another good friend of Nate&#x2019;s, who had recently returned from a research trip to Europe. Aurit was talking to a girl named Hannah, whom Nate had met before here and there&#x2014;a thin, pert-breasted writer, pleasant-looking in spite of rather angular features. She was almost universally regarded as nice and smart, or smart and nice. Seated on the loveseat was a woman Elisa knew from college. Nate couldn&#x2019;t remember her name and had met her too many times to ask. He knew she was a lawyer. The weak-chinned suit with his arm draped over her shoulder was, presumably, the banker she was hot to marry. <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve been wondering when you were going to grace us with your company,&#x201d; Jason said as soon as Nate had both feet in the door. <br>Nate set his messenger bag on the floor. &#x201c;I ran into some trouble on the way.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;The G?&#x201d; Aurit asked sympathetically. <br>There followed murmurs of agreement that the G, among all the New York subway lines, was especially unreliable. <br>Nate took the only available seat, next to Elisa&#x2019;s college friend. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s good to see you,&#x201d; he said, with as much warmth as he could conjure. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s been a while.&#x201d; <br>She looked at him levelly. &#x201c;You and Elisa were still going out.&#x201d; <br>Nate thought he detected an accusation in her voice&#x2014;as in &#x201c;it was before you trampled all over her self-esteem and ruined her happiness.&#x201d; <br>He forced himself to hold his smile. &#x201c;In any case, it&#x2019;s been too long.&#x201d; <br>Nate introduced himself to her banker boyfriend and tried to get the guy talking. If he&#x2019;d just refer to her by name, Nate would at least be relieved of one anxiety. But the ex-frat boy mostly let her answer for him (equity research, Bank of America, former Merrill Lynch, transition stressful). His preferred means of communication appeared to be nonverbal: a fixed sm...</p><h2>Six Dinner Sid</h2><p>Sid the cat is probably the luckiest and greediest cat in the world. He has six owners so he eats six times a day and his life is just about perfect. One day however he is found out!</p><p>Inga began illustrating while she was still at school where she had a constant and irresistible urge to liven up boring passages of Latin with cartoons, likewise physics and chemistry tests. It wasn&#39;t until many years later, that she saw illustration as something you could do as a career. She had no formal training but she did have a good grounding in technical drawing and patience and discipline. She wrote and illustrated her first books in Australia and then returned to England. As well as writing her own books, she has illustrated several classics such as Wind in the Willows and The Secret Garden. She can&#39;t see a time when she would want to stop making picture books - not altogether. It&#39;s one of the most enjoyable things you can do!PreSchool-Grade 1-- In Sid's neighborhood on Aristotle Street, the residents don't talk to one another. So it's simple for Sid, a six-dinner cat, to make six different people think he belongs to them. He works hard for his suppers, with six different names and six types of behavior. But when a cough precipitates six visits to the animal hospital, he is found out by the observant vet. His owners agree to make sure he receives only one meal a day, but since Sid is six-dinner cat, he just moves to Pythagoras Place where the neighbors do talk to one another and don't mind sharing dinner with him. Moore's large, colored pencil illustrations are realistic and fill the pages. She is especially strong in portraying individualized characters in the multiethnic neighborhood and the wonderful feline playfulness and insouciance of Sid. The text is rhythmic and the plot is one that children can follow and enjoy. Moore's text and lush illustrations work together to create a book that can be shared one-on-one or with a group. Readers will be happy to have this cat come back again and again. --Marge Loch-Wouters, Menasha Public Library, WI<br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Practices of Christian Preaching: Essentials for Effective Proclamation</h2><p>Leading homiletician Jared Alc�ntara offers a practice-centered, collaborative, technologically innovative, next-generation introductory preaching textbook.

Phillip Cary explains how Luther's theology arose from the Christian tradition, particularly from the spirituality of Augustine. Luther departed from the Augustinian tradition and inaugurated distinctively Protestant theology when he identified the Gospel that gives us Christ as its key concept. More than any other theologian, Luther succeeds in carrying out the Protestant intention of putting faith in the Gospel of Christ alone. Cary also explores the consequences of Luther's teachings as they unfold in the history of Protestantism.<br><br>"Cary gives a clear and concise definition of the meaning of Protestant theology. Luther's sacramental conception of the Gospel is the meaning of Protestant theology; even more, it is the essence of Christianity, the key to the right interpretation of the Bible, and the root of the orthodox doctrine of the Trinity.

My in-laws have spent their entire marriage in vocational ministry&#x2014;serving as missionaries in Indonesia and Malaysia and traveling around the globe. Overall, they have aged really well and have remained in good health. As we watched the slide show of their fifty years together, I was struck with the reality of what fifty years do to a person&#x2019;s hair color, muscle tone, skin elasticity, and waistline.<br> <br>At the time, Lora and I had been married for twenty-two years, and I found my mind wandering and wondering about what our fiftieth anniversary would be like. More accurately, I started thinking about what we would look like. I did the math. I&#x2019;ll be seventy-seven. Lora will be&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. well&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. less than that.<br> <br>I glanced at my in-laws and thought, What will we look like? Will there be more wrinkles? A few more pounds? What color hair? Will I even have hair?<br> <br>If we ever do stop and think about what our marriage will be like at fifty years, we all too often think only about the external&#x2014;the physical. But the truth is, there&#x2019;s a far more important question to ponder: Should the Lord allow us to make it to fifty years of marriage, what will we be like at our fiftieth anniversary?<br> <br>In other words&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. will we finish strong?<br> <br>�&nbsp;Will we be thriving? Or will we be surviving?<br> <br>�&nbsp;Will we be enjoying an intimate and connected marriage? Or will we be two strangers living in the same home?<br> <br>�&nbsp;Will we intentionally be wise in how we spend our days? Or will we foolishly let the months and years pass by?<br> <br>Psalm 90:12 says, &#x201c;Teach us to number our days aright, that we may gain a heart of wisdom.&#x201d; Psalm 90 is the oldest psalm and was written by Moses toward the end of the time of Israel&#x2019;s wandering in the wilderness. Those days were filled with challenges, grumbling, frustrations, and difficulties. Throughout the psalm, Moses reminds the Israelites of how quickly this life passes by: &#x201c;A thousand years in your sight are like a day that has just gone by&#x201d; (verse 4). He also reminds them that we have only a finite number of days: &#x201c;Our days may come to seventy years, or eighty, if our strength endures; yet the best of them are but trouble and sorrow, for they quickly pass, and we fly away&#x201d; (verse 10).<br> <br>Every time I read those words from Psalm 90, I&#x2019;m reminded of how quickly time goes by. We recently celebrated twenty-five years of marriage, and it feels like our wedding day was only yesterday. It seems like our children were just born, and yet two of them are in college and our younger two sons are in high school. The past twenty-five years have flown! And for that matter, fifty years fly by as well&#x2014;especially in our marriages.<br> <br>When we first start out on our marriage adventure, it seems that we have forever ahead of us. And then, life happens. Babies come along. Career paths change. School starts. Finances get tight. And before you know it, life is going faster than you realize.<br> <br>In the midst of all of this, many couples become passive in their approach to their marriage and wake up one day wondering what went wrong. They operate their marriages in what we call default mode: things happen without planning or intentionality or effort. Instead of the default mode, we need a proactive approach for our marriages to grow. The call that we&#x2019;re sending out is this: Get out of the default mode in your marriage. Live at a higher level! There has to be a plan. The old adage is right: Fail to plan, plan to fail.<br> <br>When marriages are not actively nurtured, they tend to go into the default mode. Usually this means that our sinful nature will be more active than our desire to please God. The default mode is where selfishness grows and flourishes. Here criticism of your spouse is accepted and even encouraged by friends. It is where fantasy tends to have a greater pull than reality and where hope for a better marriage dies.<br> <br>In the default mode, we get stuck in ruts. Perhaps you have had the exact same fights with your spouse over and over again, without acceptable resolution. Most couples do, because most couples live their marriages on automatic. When you get right down to it, the main problem is often that couples do not prioritize the time necessary to keep a marriage growing and alive.<br> <br>A proactive approach to marriage says that this relationship is so important to you that you are going to actively ensure its success and health with preventive medicine and a focus on growth rather than crisis management. Therefore, you are willing to put in the time and intentionality required to ensure your success.<br> <br>We find it interesting that one of the struggles we have with couples whom we are counseling is getting them to commit to time each week with each other. Many insist that the time isn&#x2019;t there. If you&#x2019;re one of these people, we would like you to consider how much time you spend:<br> <br>�&nbsp;Watching television<br> <br>�&nbsp;Working extra hours<br> <br>�&nbsp;Going to movies<br> <br>�&nbsp;Working on a committee<br> <br>�&nbsp;Reading<br> <br>�&nbsp;Talking to friends<br> <br>�&nbsp;Watching or participating in sports<br> <br>�&nbsp;Shopping for fun<br> <br>�&nbsp;Doing your favorite hobby<br> <br>�&nbsp;Playing on the computer<br> <br>�&nbsp;Doing volunteer work<br> <br>�&nbsp;Attending or running church activities<br> <br>We contend that if you have time to do any or many of these activities, you have time to spend on your marriage. Are any of these more important than your marriage?<br> <br>&#x201c;Wait a second!&#x201d; you might say. &#x201c;Church activities are on that list! Isn&#x2019;t that a good thing on which to spend time?&#x201d; Of course, but we&#x2019;ve met many good Christians who help out at church yet treat their spouses in a very dishonoring way, not giving the spouse the time she or he deserves. We greatly believe in serving Christ by volunteering at church but believe that the church would grow stronger and more authentic if members would prioritize having a godly marriage even over helping at the church. Our position is that if you build a healthier marriage, you will have more energy and actually be more effective in helping at your church.<br> <br>The state of many marriages is busyness. We often see it in the couples we counsel. It&#x2019;s not that they don&#x2019;t love each other. It&#x2019;s not that their problems are so great that they can&#x2019;t deal with them. Often, their lack of intentionality to grow and guard their marriage has them in a place where they don&#x2019;t feel connected anymore. They&#x2019;ve stopped being vulnerable and intentional. Intimacy suffers. Weeks or even months tend to pass without having an honest dialogue about how their marriage is really doing. But that&#x2019;s not how things started.<br> <br>Nearly every couple who stood in front of a church on their wedding day exchanged vows and longed for an intimate, authentic, and growing marriage. No one stands there with their fingers crossed during the &#x201c;to have and to hold&#x201d; part of the vows. We were excited and confident and hopeful for what the future had in store. That&#x2019;s how Lora and I started our marriage. But around year six, we found ourselves busy with children and, in many ways, going through the motions of our marriage. And then four great couples reached out to us, and we began to connect with them weekly, spending most of our time together intentionally growing our marriage through authentic and vulnerable communication. Through those nights, we developed a plan that led us to deeper intentionality in tending to our marriage.<br> <br>Every marriage can benefit from an intentional plan. What if there was a tool that would help you have a weekly intentional conversation about your marriage&#x2014;a tool that would help you grow in spiritual, emotional, and physical intimacy?<br> <br>That&#x2019;s where The 50 Fridays Marriage Challenge comes in!<br> <br>The challenge is simple and fun. Each week as a couple, you will spend a few minutes answering one question that has been designed to help you have open and honest conversation as you connect with and enjoy each other. Some weeks you will laugh as you travel down memory lane together. Some weeks you will be challenged as you evaluate different aspects of your marriage. And other weeks you will dream and plan for what the future can become. Our hope is that The 50 Fridays Marriage Challenge will give a troubled couple new hope, a happy couple a tool for ongoing closeness, and a newly married couple a unique way to know each other more deeply.<br> <br>Intentionally growing intimacy in your marriage is such a valuable investment. The return on this investment brings a benefit far beyond your marriage. All of us are leaving a legacy through our marriages to our children and to our friends. We can choose the kind of legacy we leave; it may be a legacy that is marked by a lack of intentionality or even apathy. Or we can leave a legacy marked by an intentional way of connecting and enjoying the years ahead so they don&#x2019;t just pass us by.<br> <br>Let&#x2019;s thrive, and not just survive, on the way to our golden anniversaries. After all, getting to fifty years starts with fifty Fridays!<br><br>The 50 Fridays Marriage Challenge 1<p></p> A FRESH START<p></p> <br>CHALLENGE 1<br> <br>How will we use the 50 Fridays Marriage Challenge each week?<br> <br>Teach us to number our days aright, that we may gain a heart of wisdom.<br> <br>&#x2014;Psalm 90:12<br> <br>Life is busy. Among our jobs, hobbies, work, and shuttling kids&#x2014;it&#x2019;s easy to stay so busy that we miss intentionally caring for and growing our marriages. Date night can become less frequent. Tender moments slip away. Heartfelt conversations vanish. And then we begin to wonder what&#x2019;s going on with our intimacy.<br> <br>If we&#x2019;re going to enjoy a healthy, God-honoring, intimate marriage, we must intentionally invest in each other. By saying &#x201c;yes&#x201d; to the 50 Fridays Marriage Challenge, you are declaring your desire to grow your marriage in spiritual, emotional, and physical intimacy. Accepting this challenge means that you&#x2019;re going to commit to a weekly intentional time to proactively engage with and talk about your marriage.<br> <br>Today&#x2019;s question should lead you to think through your expectations and some of the logistics for the 50 Fridays Marriage Challenge. Take some time together to discuss how you will use each week&#x2019;s question. For example:<br> <br>�&nbsp;When will you discuss the question? (Bedtime might not be a good idea!)<br> <br>�&nbsp;Where will you discuss the question? (Let me recommend face-to-face, not over the phone or by e-mail.)<br> <br>�&nbsp;Who will be responsible for initiating that time? (Husbands, this is a great opportunity for us!)<br> <br>�&nbsp;How will you decide who answers the question first? (Rock, paper, scissors?)<br> <br>�&nbsp;Will you commit to spend some time praying with each other at the end of the discussion?<br> <br>�&nbsp;What will you do when one of the questions creates some tension?<br> <br>�&nbsp;Would this be a good time to start a journal together?<br> <br>Don&#x2019;t let any of these questions create pressure. There&#x2019;s not a right or a wrong way to do this. What works for your marriage is what matters. Remember, the purpose of the challenge is to encourage communication together. Sometimes it&#x2019;s hard work. But it&#x2019;s always worth it. So develop an intentional plan for how you&#x2019;ll use the 50 Fridays Marriage Challenge and then jump in!<br> <br>Communicating is often a burdensome task, but it is a task that must be accomplished for a marriage to be complete. When communication falters, the marriage is in trouble. When it fails, the marriage is virtually doomed.<br> <br>&#x2014;R. C.

His smile was filled with incredible pride.<br><br>The last two weekends he'd been caught up with patients, and he'd missed working outside with Casey, enjoying the fresh air, using his hands and body until the physical strain tired him.<br><br>Summer scents were heavy in the air, drifting to him as he layered another replacement board on the fence and hammered it in. A warm, humid breeze stirred his hair, bringing with it the promise of a harsh evening storm. He'd inhaled deeply, thinking how perfect his life was.<br><br>Then his son shouted, "Holy sh&#x2014;ah, heck!" catching Sawyer's attention.<br><br>Not knowing what to expect, Sawyer turned in the direction Casey pointed his hammer and disbelief filled him as a rusted sedan, moving at breakneck speed, came barreling down the gravel road bordering their property. The turn at the bottom, hugging the Kentucky hills, was sharp; the car would never make it.<br><br>Sawyer got a mere glimpse of a pale, wide-eyed female face behind the wheel before, tires squealing, gravel flying, the car came right through the fence he'd just repaired, splintering wood and scattering nails, forcing him to leap for cover. Sheer momentum sent the car airborne for a few feet before it hit the grassy ground with a loud thump and was propelled forward several more feet to slide hood first into a narrow cove of the lake. The front end was submerged, hissing and bubbling, while the trunk and back wheels still rested on solid land, leaving the car at a crazy tilt.<br><br>Both Sawyer and Casey stood frozen for several seconds, stunned by what had happened, before un-gluing their feet and rushing to the edge of the small cove. Without hesitation, Casey waded waist-deep into the water and peered in the driver's window. "It's a girl!"<br><br>Sawyer pushed him aside and leaned down.<br><br>His breath caught and held. <em>Girl</em> wasn't exactly an apt description of the unconscious woman inside. In a heartbeat, he took in all her features, scanning her from head to toes. As a doctor, he looked for signs of injury, but as a man, he appreciated how incredibly, utterly feminine she was. He guessed her to be in her mid-twenties. Young, a tiny woman, but definitely full grown.<br><br>The window was thankfully open, giving him easy access to her, but water rapidly washed into the car, almost covering her shins. Silently cursing himself and his masculine, knee-jerk reaction to her, he told Casey, "Go to the truck and call Gabe at the house. Tell him to meet us out front."<br><br>Casey hurried off while Sawyer considered the situation. The woman was out cold, her head slumped over the steering wheel, her body limp. The backseat of the car was filled with taped cardboard boxes and luggage, some of which had tumbled forward, landing awkwardly against her. A few open crates had dumped, and items&#x2014;bric-a-brac, books and framed photos&#x2014;were strewn about. It was obvious she'd been packed up for a long trip&#x2014;or a permanent one.<br><br>Sawyer reached for her delicate wrist and was rewarded to feel a strong pulse. Her skin was velvety smooth, warm to the touch. He carefully placed her hand back in her lap, keeping it away from the icy cold water.<br><br>It took some doing, but he got the driver's door wedged open. If the car had surged a little deeper into the lake, he never would have managed it. More water flooded in. The woman moaned and turned her head, pushing away from the steering wheel, then dropping forward again. Her easy, unconscious movements assured Sawyer she had no spinal or neck injuries. After moving the fallen objects away from her, he carefully checked her slender arms, slipping his fingers over her warm flesh, gently flexing each elbow, wrist and shoulder. He drew his hands over her jeans-clad legs beneath the water, but again found no injuries. Her lips parted and she groaned, a rasping, almost breathless sound of pain. Frowning, Sawyer examined the swelling bump on her head. He didn't like it that she was still out, and her skin felt a little too warm, almost feverish.<br><br>Casey came to a skidding, sloshing halt beside him, sending waves to lap at Sawyer's waist. His gaze was narrowed with concern on the woman's face. "Gabe offered to bring you your bag, but I told him I'd call him back if you needed it." He spoke in a whisper, as if afraid of disturbing her. "We're taking her to the house with us, aren't we?"<br><br>"Looks like." If she didn't come to on the way to the house, he'd get her over to the hospital. But that was a good hour away, and most people in Buckhorn chose him over the hospital anyway, unless the situation was truly severe. And even then, it was generally his call.<br><br>He'd decide what to do after he determined the extent of her injuries. But first things first; he needed to get her out of the car and away from the debilitating effects of the cold water and hot sun.<br><br>Luckily, they weren't that far away from the house. He owned fifty acres, thick with trees and scrub bushes and wildflowers. The lake, long and narrow like a river, bordered the back of his property for a long stretch of shore. The ten acres surrounding the house and abutting the lake were kept mowed, and though it couldn't be called an actual road, there was a worn dirt path where they often brought the truck to the cove to fish or swim. Today they'd driven down to make repairs to a worn fence.<br><br>A crooked smile tipped up one side of his mouth. Thanks to the lady, the repairs to the fence were now more necessary than ever.<br><br>Sawyer carefully slid one arm beneath her legs, the other behind the small of her back. Her head tipped toward him, landing softly on his bare, sweaty shoulder. Her hair was a deep honey-blond with lighter sun streaks framing her face. It smelled of sunshine and woman, and he instinctively breathed in the scent, letting it fill his lungs. Her hair was long enough to drag across the car seat as he lifted her out. "Grab her keys and purse, then get the shirt I left by the fence." He needed to cover her, and not only to counter the chill of the lake water.<br><br>He was almost ashamed to admit it, even to himself, but he'd noticed right off that her white T-shirt was all but transparent with the dousing she'd taken. And she wasn't wearing a bra.<br><br>He easily shook that observation from his mind.<br><br>Even with her clothes soaked, the woman weighed next to nothing, but still it was an effort to climb the small embankment out of the lake without jarring her further. She'd lost one thin sandal in the wreck, and now the other fell off with a small splash. The mud squished beneath Sawyer's boots, making for unsure footing. Casey scrambled out ahead, then caught at Sawyer's elbow, helping to steady him. Once they were all on the grassy embankment, Casey ran off to follow the rest of his instructions, but was back in a flash with the shirt, which he helped Sawyer arrange around her shoulders. Sawyer kept her pressed close to his chest, preserving her privacy and saving his son from major embarrassment.<br><br>"You want me to drive?" Walking backward,<br><br>Casey managed to keep his gaze on the woman and avoid tripping.<br><br>"Yeah, but slowly. No unnecessary bumps, okay?" Casey was still learning the rudiments of changing gears, and he used any excuse to get behind the wheel.<br><br>"No problem, I'll just.." His voice trailed off as the woman stirred, lifting one limp hand to her forehead.<br><br>Sawyer stopped, holding her securely in his arms. He stared down at her face, waiting for her to regain complete awareness, strangely anticipating her reaction. "Easy now."<br><br>Her lashes were thick and dark brown tipped with gold and they fluttered for a moment before her eyes slowly opened&#x2014;and locked on his. Deep, deep blue, staring into him, only inches away.<br><br>Sawyer became aware of several things at once: her soft, accelerated breath on his throat, the firmness of her slim thighs on his bare arm, her breasts pressing through the damp cotton of her shirt against his ribs. He could feel the steady drumming of her heartbeat, and the way her body now stiffened the tiniest bit. He felt a wave of tingling awareness shudder through his body, from his chest all the way to his thighs. His reaction to her was out of proportion, considering the circumstances and his usual demeanor. He was a physician, for God's sake, and didn't, in the normal course of things, even notice a woman as a woman when medical treatment was required.<br><br>Right now, he couldn't help but notice. Holding this particular woman was somehow altogether different. So often, he put aside his tendencies as a man in deference to those of a doctor; being a doctor was such an enormous part of him. But now he found it difficult to separate the two. The doctor was present, concerned for her health and determined to give her the best of his care. But the man was also there, acutely aware of her femininity and unaccountably responding to it in a very basic way. He'd never faced such a pickle before, and he felt equal parts confusion, curiosity and something entirely too close to embarrassment. For a moment while they stared at each other, it was so silent, he imagined he could hear her thoughts.<br><br>Then she slugged him.<br><br>Though she had no strength at all and her awkward blow barely grazed him, he was so taken by surprise he nearly dropped her. While Casey stood there gawking, making no effort to help, Sawyer struggled to maintain his hold and his balance with a squirming woman in his arms.<br><br>Out of sheer self-preservation, he lowered her bare feet to the ground&#x2014;then had to catch her again as she swayed and almost crumpled. She would have fallen if both he and Casey hadn't grabbed hold of some part of her, but she still made the feeble effort to shrug them both away.<br><br>"No!" she said in a rough, whispering croak, as if her panicked voice could do no better.<br><br>"Hey, now," Sawyer crooned, trying the tone he'd often heard his brother Jordan use when talking to a sick or frightened animal. "You're okay."<br><br>She tried to swing at him again, he ducked back, and she whirled in a clumsy circle, stopping when her small fist made contact with Casey's shoulder. Casey jumped a good foot, unhurt but startled, then rubbed his arm.<br><br>Enough was enough.<br><br>Sawyer wrapped his arms around her from behind, both supporting and restraining her. "Shh. It's okay," he said, over and over again. She appeared somewhat disoriented, possibly from the blow to her head. "Settle down now before you hurt yourself."<br><br>His words only prompted more struggles, but her movements were ineffectual.<br><br>"Lady," he whispered very softly, "you're terrorizing my son."<br><br>With a gasp, she glanced up at Casey, who looked young and very strong, maybe bursting with curiosity, but in no way terrorized.<br><br>Sawyer smiled, then continued in calm, even tones. "Listen to me now, okay? Your car landed in our lake and we fished you out. You were unconscious. It's probable you have a concussion, on top of whatever else ails you."<br><br>"Let me go."<br><br>Her body shook from head to toe, a mixture of shock and illness, Sawyer decided, feeling that her skin was definitely too hot. "If I let you go you'll fall flat on your face. That or try to hit my boy again."<br><br>If anything, she panicked more, shaking her head wildly. "No..."<br><br>After glaring at Sawyer, Casey held both arms out to his sides. "Hey, lady, I'm not hurt. I'm fine."<br><br>His neck turned red, but his voice was as calm and soothing as his father's. "Really. Dad just wants to help you."<br><br>"Who are you?"<br><br>She wasn't talking to Casey now. All her attention seemed to be on staying upright. Even with Sawyer's help, she was wobbly. He gently tightened his hold, keeping her close and hindering her futile movements. "Sawyer Hudson, ma'am. I'm the man who owns this property. Me and my brothers. As I said, you landed in my lake. But I'm also a doctor and I'm going to help you." He waited for a name, for a reciprocal introduction, but none was forthcoming.<br><br>"Just...just let me go."<br><br>Slowly, still maintaining his careful hold on her, he turned them both until they faced the lake. "You see your car? It's not going anywhere, honey. Not without a tow truck and some major repairs."<br><br>She gasped, and her entire body went rigid. "You know my name."<br><br>He didn't understand her, but he understood shock. "Not yet, but I will soon. Now." He paused as her face washed clean of color and she pressed one hand to her mouth. Sawyer quickly lowered her to her knees, still supporting her from behind. "You going to be sick?"<br><br>"Oh, God."<br><br>"Now just take a few deep breaths. That's it." To Casey, he said, "Go get the water," and his son took off at a sprint, his long legs eating up the ground.<br><br>Sawyer turned back to the woman and continued in his soft, soothing tone. "You feel sick because of the blow to your head. It's all right." At least, he thought that was the cause. She also felt feverish, and that couldn't be attributed to a concussion. After a moment of watching her gulp down deep breaths, he asked, "Any better?"<br><br>She nodded. Her long fair hair hung nearly to the ground, hiding her face like a silky, tangled curtain. He wrapped it around his hand and pulled it away so he could see her clearly. Her eyes were closed, her mouth pinched. Casey rushed up with the water bottle, and Sawyer held it to her lips. "Take a few sips. There you go. Real slow, now." He watched her struggling for control and wished for some way to lessen the nausea for her. "Let's get you out of this hot sun, okay? I can get you more comfortable in a jiffy."<br><br>"I need my car."<br><br>Didn't she remember crashing into the water? Sawyer frowned. "Let me take you to my house, get you dried off and give your belly a chance to settle. I'll have one of my brothers pull your car out and see about having it towed to the garage to be cleaned..."<br><br>"No!"<br><br></p><h2>Jeanne Rose: Herbal Body Book: The Herbal Way to Natural Beauty &amp; Health for Men &amp; Women</h2><p><i>Jeanne Rose's Herbal Body Book</i> pairs a wide variety of ailments with possible plant cures.

From a prisoner in a communist jail cell to a leader of the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace in Rome, Francis Xavier Nguyen Van Thuan remained a man of unshakable faith and undying hope.</p><p>Known to many Catholics through his writings (Testimony of Hope; The Road of Hope), Vietnam's late Cardinal Francis Xavier Nguyen Van Thuan's amazing story is told by a former fellow seminarian who knew him from the time the cardinal was 18. Chau initially declined the cardinal's request to write about his life, but in 1999, reluctantly agreed, finishing the book just a few months before the cardinal died in 2002. Chau has meticulously chronicled Cardinal Thuan's life and that of his prominent family, which paid dearly for its involvement in the quest for Vietnam's independence. To help the reader navigate through a complex cast of characters, Chau has included a glossary and an explanation of Vietnamese personal names. He portrays Cardinal Thuan as a humble man who gladly would have served as a rural pastor, but was marked for leadership in the church early on. Even as he prepared for this role studying in Europe, Cardinal Thuan had a premonition that he would suffer martyrdom, and indeed, after being named coadjutor archbishop of Saigon in 1975, he was arrested by Communist authorities. Thuan subsequently spent 13 years in prison, which shaped his spirituality and leadership. Although this is not a critical biography, but the work of an admirer who also wrote a biography of the cardinal's mother, it serves to introduce one of Vietnam's most venerable religious leaders to a wider audience. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Freefall: A Novel</h2><p><p><strong>A MOST ANTICIPATED BOOK OF 2019:</strong></p><p><em><strong>Entertainment Weekly</strong></em><strong>&nbsp;|&nbsp;</strong><em><strong>USA Today</strong></em><strong>&nbsp;|&nbsp;</strong><em><strong>Parade</strong></em><strong>&nbsp;|&nbsp;</strong><em><strong>Cosmopolitan</strong></em><strong>&nbsp;|&nbsp;</strong><em><strong>New York Post</strong></em><strong>&nbsp;| PopSugar | Goodreads</strong></p><p><strong>&#x201c;Jessica Barry&#x2019;s <em>Freefall</em> is not only an enthralling, impossible-to-put down mystery that keeps the pages flying, but it is also a gorgeous, resonant tale of a mother&#x2019;s unconditional love for her daughter.

Wengert addresses key points of debate regarding Luther&#39;s approach to the Bible that have often been misunderstood, including biblical authority, the distinction between law and gospel, the theology of the cross, and biblical ethics. He argues that Luther, when rightly understood, offers much wisdom to Christians searching for fresh approaches to the interpretation of Scripture. This brief but comprehensive overview is filled with insights on Luther&#39;s theology and its significance for contemporary debates on the Bible, particularly the New Perspective on Paul.</p><p>"Wengert shows his mastery of Luther with this study of the Reformer's biblical interpretation. Here we read Scripture with Luther and move beyond fundamentalistic and liberal perspectives. We encounter fresh approaches to authority, method, interpretation, and the practice of scriptural interpretation with Luther's biblical ethics. This is a fine work."<br>--<b>Donald K. McKim</b>, editor of <i>The Cambridge Companion to Martin Luther<br></i><br>"Wengert's remarkable skill as a pastoral theologian and theologian for pastors is evident as he applies Luther's insights on proclaiming the gospel to issues such as biblical authority, the domestication of texts by both fundamentalists and liberals, relating the Old Testament to the New, the 'New Perspective on Paul,' biblical ethics, and the general modern penchant to try to understand rather than 'stand under' biblical texts. Required reading for preachers of all denominations!"<br>--<b>Carter Lindberg</b>, Boston University School of Theology<br><br>"Martin Luther's faith journey took him deep into the Scriptures, looking for God. Timothy Wengert lifts up Luther's most essential discoveries in that search and offers them to scholars and seekers alike as a guide to reading the Bible."<br>--<b>Roy Riley</b>, former bishop of the New Jersey Synod, ELCA<br><br>"Wengert's exposition of Luther is passionate, practical, and provocative--a marvelous exercise in theological and historical spring-cleaning. In the context of today's Protestant Christianity, Luther emerges as an iconoclast and a maverick likely to bring no easy comfort either to liberals or to conservatives. Not everyone will agree with every move Luther made, but everyone ought to ponder what Luther taught about reading the Bible. To that end, Wengert is an engaging and joyous guide."<br>--<b>John L. Thompson</b>, author of <i>Reading the Bible with the Dead: What You Can Learn from the History of Exegesis That You Can't Learn from Exegesis Alone<br></i><br>"Wengert leads readers into Luther's study and directs their reading of Scripture through Luther's law/gospel hermeneutics, assessing from a specific, twenty-first-century North American perspective how the Reformer's Christ-centered delivery of the biblical message functions. Wengert challenges contemporary students of the Bible to find its authority and message by letting the text master them rather than through their own attempt to master God's Word."<br>--<b>Robert Kolb</b>, Concordia Seminary, Saint Louis, Missouri<b>Timothy J.

Where were you when the lights went out?</b> <br> <br> A New York City resident for many years, Carol Higgins Clark was there during the blackout of 2003. Not surprisingly, she felt that Regan and Jack Reilly should one day share the experience! <br> <br> As <i>Zapped</i> begins, the Reillys return home from a summer weekend to the loft in Tribeca they are in the agonizing process of renovating and expanding. They are looking forward to a quiet supper on their newly acquired rooftop terrace. But it's not meant to be. While Jack goes to pick up Chinese food, Regan enters their apartment, unaware that a nervous thief, who preceded her by minutes, is hiding in the front closet. A thief who knows about a hidden safe that Regan and Jack have yet to discover. Minutes later, the blackout strikes, and both Reillys are called into action. <br> <br> A new gallery in SoHo, featuring treasured glass sculptures from all over the world, has been burglarized. As head of the NYPD Major Case Squad, Jack oversees several departments. Art theft is one of them. <br> <br> PI Regan hears from her best friend, Kit, who is in Manhattan on business. She's been abandoned at a comedy club by a colleague from an insurance convention, Georgina Mathieson, who ran out for a cigarette moments before the blackout struck and never came back. Kit gets a call that Georgina is disturbed and dangerous. Fueled by her rage at a college boyfriend who dumped her, Georgina seeks revenge on unsuspecting young blond men. She was last seen getting into a cab outside the club -- with a tall blond. Regan heads the search for Georgina and her potential victim. <br> <br> Meanwhile, Lorraine Lily, an almost famous actress, returns to New York City the night of the blackout, after spending three months in England doing a play, and is informed by her estranged husband, Conrad Spreckles, that he'd sold his loft to their next-door neighbors, the Reillys. Lorraine had never told him about the hidden safe she'd had installed in the closet. If she doesn't get back what's in there, she's sure her budding career will be ruined. <br> <br> In <i>Zapped</i>, Clark takes readers on a tour of the city they won't forget and introduces them to a wonderful cast of colorful, eccentric characters whose stories intersect in precarious and often humorous ways during one very dark and hot summer night.</p><p>Carol Higgins Clark is the author of&nbsp;the bestselling Regan Reilly mysteries.

The unbearably hot night did nothing to improve her mood. Her high heels were killing her feet and she was tired. When she finally made it to the front of the line, the next yellow cab pulled up quickly. The driver popped the trunk, got out, and eyed her one carry-on bag.<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s it?&#x201d; he asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;They lost my luggage.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What a surprise,&#x201d; he grunted. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry. In this weather, all you need is a bathing suit. Hop in.&#x201d;<br> <br>In the back of the cab, Lorraine was grateful to find that at least the air-conditioning was functioning at a decent level. She pushed her auburn hair off her forehead and sighed. The driver looked at her through the rearview mirror.<br> <br>&#x201c;Where are you going?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Downtown Manhattan.&#x201d; She gave him the address.<br> <br>His only reaction was to step on the gas.<br> <br>Lorraine reached into her massive handbag, pulled out her cell phone, and took a deep breath. How many more deep breaths am I going to need in my life? she wondered. She was sick of people telling her to take a deep breath. Everyone from the baggage claims supervisor to her estranged husband, Conrad. She&#x2019;d had a wonderful three months away, and now it was back to reality.<br> <br>P. Conrad Spreckles picked up on the second ring.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve landed,&#x201d; she told him.<br> <br>&#x201c;Back on home soil,&#x201d; he responded in a remote tone.<br> <br>&#x201c;They lost my luggage.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s probably wandering the earth. Just like its owner.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I wasn&#x2019;t wandering the earth, dear. I was acting in an important new play that could be a springboard for my career.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;In a remote town in England with a population of eleven people. You may as well have performed it in our basement up here in Greenwich.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We had wonderful audiences,&#x201d; Lorraine protested. &#x201c;You wouldn&#x2019;t know since you didn&#x2019;t bother to come. Listen, Conrad, we need to talk. But right now I&#x2019;m too tired. I&#x2019;ll sleep at the loft and take a car to Connecticut in the morning.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s nothing to talk about,&#x201d; he said flatly. &#x201c;I filed for divorce.&#x201d;<br> <br>Lorraine gasped. She was shocked that he&#x2019;d taken such a drastic step. Not that she wanted to stay married. But she was hoping to be supported for a while longer while she pursued her career. Doing her best to sound saddened, she murmured. &#x201c;Well, Conrad, if that&#x2019;s how you feel...&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s how I feel.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay. I&#x2019;ll spend the night at the apartment...&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You can&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Why not?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I sold it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You sold it?&#x201d; Lorraine shrieked. The cabbie turned around to take a quick look, then shifted his attention back to the road. She lowered her voice and hissed, &#x201c;How could you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Funny you took the news very well about parting ways with me. But the thought of losing the apartment...&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You had no right.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I had every right. The loft was mine. It says so very clearly in the prenuptial agreement you signed two years ago.&#x201d; Conrad laughed mirthlessly. &#x201c;That was when I believed you loved me for me instead of my money.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I did love you...&#x201d; Lorraine protested. &#x201c;I mean I DO love you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Serves me right for letting my head be turned by a beautiful woman more than twenty years younger. Anyway, time to move on. I&#x2019;ll sell the house&#x2014;the love nest we were going to be so happy in for the rest of our lives&#x2014;and you&#x2019;ll get half.&#x201d;<br> <br>Lorraine felt physically ill. &#x201c;Who did you sell the loft to?&#x201d; she sputtered.<br> <br>&#x201c;Our next-door neighbor Jack Reilly and his new wife, Regan. When they returned from their honeymoon three months ago, I made them an offer they couldn&#x2019;t refuse. They&#x2019;re already in the process of combining the two apartments. I&#x2019;m sure they&#x2019;ll find a lot more happiness within those walls than we ever did. Although I suspect you might have experienced more happiness there than I ever knew about.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s not true!&#x201d; Lorraine cried. &#x201c;I only went there to rehearse scenes with my acting partners or have an occasional yoga session. I needed that apartment for my creativity and my alone time.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I understand they have wonderful rehearsal space for rent at Carnegie Hall. Tonight you can come up here and stay in the guest room, or you can check into a hotel&#x2014;your decision. You&#x2019;ll be hearing from my lawyer.&#x201d;<br> <br>He hung up.<br> <br>Lorraine&#x2019;s head was reeling. Jack Reilly was a cop. His wife was an investigator. If they discovered the safe she had installed behind the built-in cabinet in the closet, her life would be ruined. I have to get in there again and soon, she thought frantically. But how? She dug through her bag for her address book. She would call the young actor she&#x2019;d rehearsed with in the loft not long before she left the States. Lorraine knew he needed money. She could tell he was the type who would help her if the price was right. Riffling through the pages, she located his number and began to dial.<br> <br>* * *<br> <br>Regan and Jack Reilly were driving south on Manhattan&#x2019;s West Side Highway, returning home from a three-day weekend on Cape Cod with Jack&#x2019;s family. It had been his father&#x2019;s birthday, and the clan had gathered to celebrate.<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re almost there,&#x201d; Jack said with relief. &#x201c;I thought coming back on a Monday, we&#x2019;d beat some of the traffic. I wish we could have stayed longer, especially with this heat...&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Me, too,&#x201d; Regan agreed. &#x201c;But if the contractor actually shows up tomorrow, it&#x2019;ll be worth sweating it out. He swore to me he&#x2019;d be there. We&#x2019;ll see.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re not sorry we got into all this are you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Not at all. I love having a shopping cart full of contractor&#x2019;s supplies parked outside our bedroom.&#x201d; Regan smiled. &#x201c;For years I&#x2019;ve listened to my mother lament about how she and my father should have bought the apartment next door to theirs when it went up for sale. We got that chance and had to take it. When this renovation is finished, we&#x2019;ll have a home we&#x2019;ll never want to leave...if by then we haven&#x2019;t gone crazy.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jack rolled his eyes. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s hope not.&#x201d; Five minutes later he was turning onto their block. &#x201c;How about if I drop you off with the bags and then go get us some Chinese food? I also want to swing by the office and pick up a report.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sounds good. I&#x2019;ll open a bottle of wine and set the table on that new rooftop terrace of ours. It might not be in the best condition yet, but there should be at least a slight breeze coming off the Hudson.&#x201d;<br> <br>They unloaded the car and placed the bags on a luggage cart.

The other great saint of the last half century - Padre Pio - offers similar revelations of his own in this enlightening collection of short excerpts from his letters.<br><br>Many books have been written on the life and works of Padre Pio, but <i>Words of Light </i>is not a book about what others think or say about him.

If you are interested in the complexities and challenges of contemporary faith, you will benefit from these short teachings, counsels, and recollections culled from some of Padre Pio's most personal writings.<br><br><i>In these letters I quickly discovered the same states of soul that were described by the great mystics. Padre Pio's own 'dark night' was in no way inferior to that described by John of the Cross, and equally the 'living flame' of his love for God dazzles the reader and allows them to catch a glimpse of another world.</i><br>- Fr.

He's talking about dreams here, the destiny that calls every living soul to some kind of greatness. What Mr. Twain doesn't say is: A dream is also a monster that wants to eat you. Nobody tells you this part of the American Dream &#x2014; until now. In this new memoir, <em>Congratulations Who Are You Again</em>, readers join Harrison Scott Key on his outrageous journey to becoming a great American writer. </p><p>As a young boy in Mississippi, Harrison possessed many special gifts, such as the ability to read and complete college applications. And yet, throughout young adulthood, he failed at many vocations, until one day, after drinking perhaps too many beers and dusting off his King James Bible, he stumbled across a passage about a lonely pelican, which burst into flame inside him. In a mad blaze of holy illumination, Harrison realized his dream: to set the world afire with the light inside him. He would write a funny book. This was his dream.</p><p>With unforgettable wit and tenderness,&nbsp;<em>Congratulations Who Are You Again </em>is Harrison&#x2019;s instructive tale of pursuing his destiny with relentless and often misguided devotion, transforming his life beyond all comprehension: He becomes a signer of autographs, a doer of interviews, a casher of checks that are "worth more money than my father had ever imagined any of us might see, this side of a drug-related felony."</p><p>On this journey, Harrison finds that as he gains the world, he stands on the precipice of losing everything that means the most: his family, his mind, his soul. Hilarious, honest, and absolutely practical, <em>Congratulations Who Are You Again</em> is a no-holds-barred look at the life of every ambitious human creature, whether you want to write books or make music, start a business or start a revolution. This is a book for the dreamers.</p><p><strong></strong>&nbsp;</p><strong></strong><p><strong></strong>&nbsp;</p></p><p><p><strong>HARRISON SCOTT KEY</strong>&#x2019;s writing has been featured in <em>The Best American Travel Writing</em>, the <em>New York Times</em>, <em>Outside</em>, <em>Salon</em>, <em>The Chronicle of Higher Education</em>, <em>McSweeney&#x2019;s Internet Tendency</em>, <em>Southern Living</em>, <em>Reader&#x2019;s Digest</em>, <em>Image</em>, <em>Creative Nonfiction</em>, <em>The Mockingbird</em>, <em>The Green County Independent</em>, <em>The American Conservative</em>, <em>Brevity</em>, <em>Gulf Coast</em>, and <em>Oxford American</em>, where he is also a contributing editor.

When we talk about censorship we talk about China, the former Soviet Union, or the Middle East. But recent political developments&#x2014;including the passage of the Patriot Act&#x2014;have shined a spotlight on profound acts of censorship in our own backyard. <em>Burn This Book</em> features a sterling roster of award-winning writers offering their incisive, uncensored views on this most essential topic, including such revered literary heavyweights as Toni Morrison, Salman Rushdie, Orhan Pamuk, David Grossman, and Nadine Gordimer, among others.</p><p>Both provocative and timely, <em>Burn This Book</em> is certain to inspire strong opinions and ignite spirited, serious dialogue.</p></p><p><p>Toni Morrison was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1993. She is the author of many novels, including <em>Sula</em>, <em>Song of Solomon</em>, <em>Beloved</em>, and, most recently, <em>A Mercy</em>. She has also received the National Book Critics Circle Award and a Pulitzer Prize for her fiction. </p>In 11 short essays by some of the world's premier novelists, this volume explores a simple question: why write? Contributor Paul Auster may put the query best: "Surely it is an odd way to spend your life-sitting alone in a room with a pen in your hand, hour after hour, day after day, year after year, struggling to put words on pieces of paper." In response, Pico Iyer delivers a moving account of a Burmese trishaw driver living under political oppression, who for years composed (by candlelight) letters to the author, many of which were censored. Orhan Pamuk also explores this intense human hunger for stories and creative freedom with an anecdote from his March 1985 tour of Turkey, on which he introduced Arthur Miller and Harold Pinter to Turkish writers who had suffered "repression, cruelty and outright evil" in a military coup. Francine Prose, on the other hand, makes a lively attempt to separate literature from politics (in which she cops to her own political biases in her choice of examples). The disparate voices produce a complex of reasons that drive writers, though all agree that, as observed by Morrison (wearing both editor and contributor caps), it's a "bleak, unlivable, insufferable existence... when we are deprived of artwork." <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He and his best mate, Derek, have some grand plans: doing nothing; having sleepovers; practicing being rock stars in their band, Dogzombies; annoying Tom's snarky older sister, Delia; and watching lots of television. Unfortunately, a letter home from Tom's teacher Mr. Fullerman puts the brakes on the fun.

His mother insists that the homework be completed before anything else and throws in the demand for a clean room to boot. Faced with this task, Tom draws a total blank and ends up drawing cobwebs in his notebook instead. Hilariously unreflective and self-absorbed, Tom aspires to avoid schoolwork at all costs and become a rock star, even though he hasn't mastered the music part and his band lacks a drummer. Tom and Greg Heffley are kindred spirits, and Tom's notebook, filled with frenetic, free-wheeling attempts to avoid homework, responsibility, Marcus Melgrew, his uncle, and all things remotely unpleasant, should entertain, if not resonate. This is not the first in the series, but readers will have no problem jumping into the story. Many terms have been Americanized, such as Mom instead of Mum, but those Briticisms that were not, such as bodged or bogey, are explained in a short glossary at the end of the book.

The book chronicles Meisinger's struggle to find a balance between her own ''personal agenda to 'save the world one client at a time' and the reality of what occurs'' between social worker and client. <p> In response to the need for undergraduate and graduate students to hear about real-life experiences working with traumatized clients, Stories of Pain, Trauma, and Survival is filled with anecdotal examples of social work with individuals and groups in a variety of settings that include nonprofit agencies, child welfare services, and veteran's health care. Each masterfully written story is followed by Meisinger's personal and professional insights on how these experiences have informed her practice. The book is useful for classroom discussions and critical self-assessments and will be helpful to beginning and seasoned social workers alike. </p><p> The primary thesis of Stories of Pain, Trauma, and Survival is that social workers can be more effective by getting ''back to basics'' and staying in touch with the core values of the profession. Meisinger notes that, one of the most important services that social workers can provide is to be fully present in ''witnessing the pain'' of a traumatized client. The self-knowledge and compassion that emerge from this mindfulness make all the difference in working with clients who are overwhelmed by difficult circumstances.</p><p>NASW Press</p><p> NASW Press, a division of National Association of Social Workers (NASW), is a leading scholarly press in the social sciences.

He is a Family Brother at Assumption Abbey, a Trappist monastery near Ava, Missouri.Chapter 1<br><br> Find Meaning in Your Work,<br><br> or Else It Just Might Kill You<br><br> I've known my friend Danny since childhood. He helped me study for the Missouri bar exam in 1992. He was a brilliant whirlwind of a lawyer who specialized in mass tort litigation, mostly what are called "toxic torts," like defective drugs that end up hurting and killing people.<br><br> He made a lot of money; I mean a lot of money. He also medicated himself with alcohol in the process. On the outside, Danny was winning. Danny the person, though, was rudderless, in pain, and without a vocation.<br><br> After almost twenty years of representing plaintiffs, winning cases, and pounding on other lawyers, Danny left the law. And do you want to know what he did next? He helped his wife start a scrapbooking business. He immersed himself in colored paper, holiday stencils, adhesive dots, and craft rubber stamps. He wanted to serve Nikki in pursuit of her passion and that's exactly what he did for four years. Unfortunately the business went south, and they moved to another city, where Nikki found a great new job.<br><br> Years earlier, while in the process of getting sober, Danny had attended a workshop that helped people discover a better version of themselves. Because he found them beneficial, he continued attending these courses over the next several years, as an assistant, while he phased out of law and into scrapbooking.<br><br> Eventually he began training to become a paid teacher of these workshops. Danny never considered that it could be a career, until he started working with Nikki. That's where the mystery of service and vocation comes into focus: while he was serving his wife-not thinking about himself-space was created for him to consider this new career, a life of helping others, with the skills he'd learned over the previous decade of workshops and training.<br><br> Danny's selfless service to Nikki was ultimately how he found himself; and importantly, it was a bridge to his vocation.<br><br> When I asked Danny to describe this, he said, "I discovered that one of my core values was kindness, in a way that on my deathbed it will matter to me: was I kind? The courtroom was no longer a place for me to live that core value." Today he travels the country leading workshops for people from all walks of life, from Orthodox Jewish teens in New York City to middle schoolers in San Diego, to LAPD gang unit cops, to people simply searching for a better life in St. Louis. He has a thriving coaching practice and makes, in his exact words, "a whole f-ing lot less" than his days as a lawyer, but he loves his life.<br><br> I've seen him at work and if there was ever a person who dodged death by finding and living out their vocation, it's my friend Danny.<br><br> Like Law for Chocolate<br><br> "Why did you quit law?"<br><br> "Why on earth chocolate?"<br><br> And my personal favorite: "I bet this career is a lot sweeter than your old one, huh?"<br><br> It's possible I've told my lawyer-to-chocolate-maker story a thousand times in the past ten years in response to those questions. From college campuses to boardrooms to tours of our chocolate factory, these are the most common questions I'm asked. And I get it. People want to know how and why I made this crazy leap. They also want to know how I manage to "do it all." How our team of sixteen people, working on a humble street in a small city in the Midwest, makes chocolate that wins awards around the world. Or how we practice direct trade with smallholder farmers across the globe. Or how our small chocolate factory is able to feed thousands of students per day in Tanzania and the Philippines with no donations. After hearing me speak, a lot of folks say-either with excitement or despair-that they wish they could do what I'm doing, but don't know how or where to start or that it all seems too daunting. I like to answer their questions with as much detail as time permits; the good, the bad, and the ugly. And my reply always centers around the fact that Askinosie Chocolate is my vocation and it's the only reason we're able to do what we do.<br><br> Askinosie Chocolate Touchstone: Direct Trade<br><br> We've been directly trading with cocoa farmers around the world since the beginning. This means we not only pay a premium for our cocoa beans, but we personally travel to each of our origin communities-Ecuador, Tanzania, and the Philippines-yearly. On these trips, I inspect our crop of beans to ensure they meet the specifications outlined in our contract. We share profits, in cash, based on a percentage of sales of the previous year's crop of cocoa beans. We translate our financials into the farmers' language and walk through it line by line, to show how we arrived at the calculation. We tour the small family farms and we discuss the health of their cacao trees; we talk about postharvest and fermentation techniques. We'll roast freshly dried cocoa beans <br><br> together over a fire to analyze their flavor. And I always bring chocolate for us all to taste, including bars made from their cocoa beans as well as our other origins. Direct trade is about relationships. It's a practice, and a way of being.<br><br> It's not as simple as "Follow your dream," which is nice, if trite, and also not that helpful. How exactly do you follow your dream? What does that look like? What are the next steps? In this chapter, I provide an alternative to this platitude by suggesting some answers to these very questions. I hope the lessons I've learned and the mistakes I've made along this path to my vocation inspire you to find meaning in your work. But before we discuss your business we need to talk about you. You have to find your personal vocation. I encourage you to follow these steps, try some of the exercises at the end of the chapter, and then go live what comes out of it.<br><br> For the record: no, making chocolate is not necessarily "sweeter" than my former life as a lawyer. Try standing at the counsel table in the well of a courtroom, shoulder to shoulder with a client-in whose innocence you believe with every fiber of your being, but who is charged with murder and might die by lethal injection-as the jury files in, the foreperson says they have reached a verdict, and the words "not guilty" are read by the judge in slow motion. Is that "sweet"? No, not exactly. But it sure is gratifying, gut-wrenching, and life affirming. Nevertheless, chocolate is what I do now and it, too, has its gratifying, gut-wrenching, life-affirming moments.<br><br> Vocation, Vocation, Vocation<br><br> My grandparents lived on the same farm in Miller, Missouri, for over sixty-five years. I think they left the state once to go with my parents, my brother, and I to Panama City Beach in 1972 (the entire trip they fretted about their animals and the weather back home). Their daily schedule was waking before the sun to milk the cows, collect the eggs, eat, tend the garden, work the fields, eat, work the fields some more, milk the cows, eat and then to bed, wake up, and repeat. I love the monastic rhythm of that work now, but I didn't appreciate it as a boy. It was boring and I didn't like helping with chores. It always seemed too hot or too cold.<br><br> But the farming life was their vocation. They were called to it and clearly loved it, all of it. The best expression of my grandmother's vocation is how she treated people who visited the farm. Everyone left with some kind of food that she had baked, canned, or picked from the garden. She insisted on it.<br><br> In South America they call it a plan de vida; in Japan, ikigai. I call it vocation-the reason you do what you do. We all need a reason to live, a reason to wake up in the morning. My grandparents woke up in the morning to grow and harvest food to nourish people. This reason for being can be cultivated in your personal life. But it's also entirely possible to create it with your work. In fact, not only is it possible, it's essential. After all, according to the math people, we spend approximately eighty thousand hours of our lifetime at work. You better hope your work fulfills you, or at the very least is enjoyable.<br><br> If you follow the advice in this book, I promise you will find some things out about yourself. My hope is that you'll uncover your personal vocation, and apply that to your business. This is not only the best way to achieve the fulfillment you seek but it's the best way to create a successful, sustainable organization. The impact of vocation reverberates throughout your life, both internally and externally, your business, your community, and the world by allowing you to realize your true self and by meeting and serving the needs of others.<br><br> Most people find it easy to recognize when something needs to change in themselves or their business, but knowing what to do about it is another matter. So many people share with me how miserable and unfulfilled they are-they know they want their work to look and feel different, but they have no concept of what to do to find out what that should be. In this chapter, I will explain how I did it; it begins with finding your personal vocation. Chapter 2 is about honing your business vocation, and while your instinct may be to skip this stuff about personal vocation, I urge you not to, because your personal vocation will lead you to your business vocation. You can sell your company and start a new one, or buy a franchise now, you can quit your job and search for another, but if you don't figure things out before you move on, you'll almost certainly find yourself in the same spot. You will not find meaning in the new work just because it's different. For some entrepreneurs this will be a painful chapter, but I ask you to bear with me and give it considerable thought, reflection, and work.<br><br> Time for a Change<br><br> I never lost a criminal jury trial. I am one of a handful of lawyers in the country who have successfully obtained a not-guilty verdict in a death penalty case. My reputation as an overprepared and aggressive criminal defense attorney was built on murder cases. Once, I had prepared so many D-ring binders that I had to rent a U-Haul trailer to drive them to the courthouse. The D-ring binders, themselves, were a source of stress for the state's expert witnesses. They made a distinct sound when I opened them up, a metallic thud. The witnesses eventually knew that when I opened a binder it was to show them a document, usually one they had authored, and that they were lying. The sound of my binder opening often caused a visible flinch. It reminded me of Pavlov's dogs.<br><br> I've crawled on my hands and knees at night, in the dark, at a crime scene to see blood spatter patterns glow with luminol. I've been to an autopsy and smelled bone dust. I've used microscopic evidence with DNA material to free a man convicted of a rape he did not commit after serving two years in solitary confinement on a sentence of seventy years. I've had death threats. The most bizarre was when someone chopped up a deer and smeared blood all over the front porch of my law office building. It never really bothered me until my family was threatened, too. That was when my wife (who hates guns) and I took tactical handgun classes. I went a step further with low-light handgun training. It got so serious, we eventually had a security expert come out to our house to practice and plan what-ifs in the event of a hostage scenario. This was when my daughter, Lawren-incidentally, a great contributor to this book-was a young girl, so we wanted to be very careful.<br><br> I loved my work, despite the sadness surrounding much of it, until I didn't.<br><br> There was one particular moment in my law career when I knew it was time to pivot and begin looking for another dream. I was representing a client named Debbie. Debbie believed, supported by evidence, that her ex-husband was sexually molesting their young daughter. For years Debbie had successfully convinced the courts to keep him away from her. Then one day a court decided, despite Debbie's valiant efforts, to allow the ex-husband his first unsupervised visit with her child in years. The day before the planned visit, Debbie, believing her daughter was about to suffer a fate worse than death, gave her a sleeping pill, carried her to the car, turned it on, closed the garage door, and let it run with the two of them inside.<br><br> When the police found them the child was dead and Debbie was near death and unconscious. She had hoped to die with her daughter. She was rushed by helicopter to another city, where she was placed in a hyperbaric oxygen chamber. When she woke up she was immediately charged with first-degree murder. The family hired me to defend her. It was a no-win case. A loss would mean that she might spend the rest of her life in prison. The absolute best I could hope for was lifetime commitment to a state mental hospital. I pled her "not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect," otherwise known as the insanity defense. Guess how many times that defense has worked in the United States? Not very many. Basically never.<br><br> This trial was particularly brutal. Due to heavy media coverage, the jury was sequestered in a nearby hotel and instructed to have no contact with the outside world. The judge and I clashed at every stage of the case.<br><br> Minutes before my opening statement was set to begin, the judge let the prosecutor mark all over my integral (not to mention expensive) exhibit with a black Sharpie. Boiling over, I remember exactly what I blurted out: "Well, Judge, why don't you just go ahead and stick a needle in her arm now and get it over with." He threatened to hold me in contempt and put me in jail if I made one more statement like that. The judge repeatedly attempted to prevent me from getting into evidence why she did what she did: that she believed her ex-husband was sexually abusing her daughter. And unfortunately there was a mountain of evidence to support her belief. It was totally relevant. But before the trial the judge ruled that evidence inadmissible. Midtrial, I appealed that decision to a higher court with no luck. So I pushed and pushed and pushed again. My job was to make a record of any possible error in the trial, so that there was a chance the case could be reversed at a higher level and sent back for a retrial. I deeply believed that not letting the jury consider that evidence was a mistake and I just couldn't let it go.</p><h2>Rainbow Quilts for Scrap Lovers: 12 Projects from Simple Squares - Choosing Fabrics &amp; Organizing Your Stash</h2><p>Learn to rescue fabric leftovers with 12 colorful quilt patterns for scrap lovers.

Rebecca, 20, and Abigail, 16, live in Scituate, Massachusetts. The crew of the British ships invades the town for supplies but flee when they hear the fife and drum of the advancing Massachusetts Home Guard. When the British return, the Home Guard has gone, but the sisters play "Yankee Doodle" from the shore. Thinking the soldiers are returning, the British ships retreat. An explanatory note separates fact from fiction, but it is long and will discourage the same readers who can handle the chapterless text that follows. Most children who pick this up won't have the necessary background on the War of 1812, and may not relate to a tale of the two young women. Painted illustrations, although colorful, are wooden. Alternating with wide-spaced and large-size print, they lack expression and movement. The drama of the young people turning back a navy may be enough to carry this story for a hi/lo audience, but its odd format and poor illustrations make it a marginal purchase. --Sally Bates Goodroe, Houston Public Library<br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Josephine Baker and the Rainbow Tribe</h2><p><p>Creating a sensation with her risqu� nightclub act and strolls down the Champs Elys�es, pet cheetah in tow, Josephine Baker lives on in popular memory as the banana-skirted siren of Jazz Age Paris.

Adopting twelve children from around the globe, she transformed her estate into a theme park, complete with rides, hotels, a collective farm, and singing and dancing. The main attraction was her Rainbow Tribe, the family of the future, which showcased children of all skin colors, nations, and religions living together in harmony. Les Milandes attracted an adoring public eager to spend money on a utopian vision, and to worship at the feet of Josephine, mother of the world.</p><p>Alerting readers to some of the contradictions at the heart of the Rainbow Tribe project--its undertow of child exploitation and megalomania in particular--Guterl concludes that Baker was a serious and determined activist who believed she could make a positive difference by creating a family out of the troublesome material of race.</p></p><p>Matthew Pratt Guterl is Professor of Africana Studies and American Studies at Brown University.&#x201c;<b>Matthew Guterl</b>&#x2019;s astonishing <i>Josephine Baker and the Rainbow Tribe</i> tells the wholly unsuspected life-story of one of the twentieth-century&#x2019;s most amazing visionaries.

Rarely does an author&#x2019;s voice come across as audibly as Guterl&#x2019;s, in cadence and sometimes in directives to the reader, and the effect is enchanting--Baker&#x2019;s story, even more so. Years after chanteuse-dancer Baker&#x2019;s soaring star fell, she rose once more, this time as a relentless civil rights advocate and the adoptive mother of 12 multiracial children, the &#x2018;Rainbow Tribe,&#x2019; whom she then raised and paraded in a theme-park-type castle, Les Milandes, in the French countryside. Here, Guterl winnows out a truth from the many fragments (in biographies, in the press, from the children themselves), positing that &#x2018;it was an inspirational, exaggerated symbol of what was possible at the extreme end of wealth and fame, globally speaking, for anyone and everyone, no matter their skin tone or racial classification.&#x2019; A fascinating book about a magnificent woman.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Eloise Kinney</b><b>, </b><b><i>Booklist</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;This book shimmers.

But in the end, it&#x2019;s a tragedy...Baker bought a French castle, adopted a dozen children, and made them stand for every race and nation in the world. It went about as well as any other supersized celebrity adoption with a political agenda.

Jan Grabowski's penetrating microhistory tells the story of the Judenjagd in Dabrowa Tarnowska, a rural county in southeastern Poland, where the majority of the Jews in hiding perished as a consequence of betrayal by their Polish neighbors. Drawing on materials from Polish, Jewish, and German sources created during and after the war, Grabowski documents the involvement of the local Polish population in the process of detecting and killing the Jews who sought their aid. Through detailed reconstruction of events, this close-up account of the fates of individual Jews casts a bright light on a little-known aspect of the Holocaust in Poland.</p></p><p>Winner, 2014 Yad Vahsem International Book Prize<p>Jan Grabowski is Professor of History at the University of Ottawa and a founding member of the Polish Center for Holocaust Research.

Ben Witherington applies to Mark the socio-rhetorical approach for which he is well known, opening a fresh new perspective on the earliest Gospel.<br><br> Written when the fledging Christian faith was experiencing a major crisis during the Jewish war, Mark provides us with the first window on how the life and teachings of Jesus were presented to a largely non-Jewish audience.<br><br> According to Witherington, the structure of Mark demonstrates that this Gospel is biographically focused on the identity of Jesus and the importance of knowing who he is--the Christ, the Son of God. This finding reveals that Christology stood at the heart of the earliest Christians' faith. It also shows how important it was to these earliest Christians to persuade others about the nature of Jesus, both as a historical figure and as the Savior of the world.</p><p>Ben Witherington III is Amos Professor of New Testament for Doctoral Studies at Asbury Theological Seminary, Wilmore, Kentucky.

Haussmann transformed the old medieval city of squalid slums and disease-ridden alleyways into a "City of Light" characterized by wide boulevards, apartment blocks, parks, squares and public monuments, new rail stations and department stores, and a new system of public sanitation. <i>City of Light</i> charts this fifteen-year project of urban renewal which--despite the interruptions of war, revolution, corruption, and bankruptcy--set a template for nineteenth and early twentieth-century urban planning and created the enduring landscape of modern Paris now so famous around the globe. <br> Lively and engaging, <i>City of Light</i> is a book for anyone who wants to know how Paris became Paris.</p><p><b>Rupert Christiansen</b> has been writing about the arts for the<i> Daily Telegraph</i> since 1996.

Charles T. Russell, their founder, advised his followers that members of Christ&#x2019;s church would be raptured in 1878, and by 1914 Christ would destroy the nations and establish his kingdom on earth. The first prophecy was not fulfilled, but the outbreak of the First World War lent some credibility to the second. Ever since that time, Jehovah&#x2019;s Witnesses have been predicting that the world would end &#x201c;shortly.&#x201d; Their numbers have grown to many millions in over two hundred countries. They distribute a billion pieces of literature annually, and continue to anticipate the end of the world.</p><p>For almost thirty years, M. James Penton&#x2019;s <em>Apocalypse Delayed</em> has been the definitive scholarly study of this religious movement. As a former member of the sect, Penton offers a comprehensive overview of the Jehovah's Witnesses. His book is divided into three parts, each presenting the Witnesses&#x2019; story in a different context: historical, doctrinal, and sociological. Some of the issues he discusses are known to the general public, such as the sect&#x2019;s opposition to military service and blood transfusions. Others involve internal controversies, including political control of the organization and the handling of dissent within the ranks.</p><p>Thoroughly revised, the third edition of Penton&#x2019;s classic text includes substantial new information on the sources of Russell&#x2019;s theology and on the church&#x2019;s early leaders, as well as coverage of important developments within the sect since the second edition was published fifteen years ago.</p></p><p><strong>M.

The <i>Life</i> is not really an autobiography at all, but rather a confession written for inquisitors by a nun whose raptures and mystical claims had aroused suspicion. Despite its troubled origins, the book has had a profound impact on Christian spirituality for five centuries, attracting admiration from readers as diverse as mystics, philosophers, artists, psychoanalysts, and neurologists.

Do they proceed differently during times of peace and times of war? In<i> Winning the Next War</i>, Stephen Peter Rosen argues that armies and navies are not forever doomed to "fight the last war." Rather, they are able to respond to shifts in the international strategic situation. He also discusses the changing relationship between the civilian innovator and the military bureaucrat.</p><p>In peacetime, Rosen finds, innovation has been the product of analysis and the politics of military promotion, in a process that has slowly but successfully built military capabilities critical to American military success. In wartime, by contrast, innovation has been constrained by the fog of war and the urgency of combat needs. Rosen draws his principal evidence from U.S. military policy between 1905 and 1960, though he also discusses the British army's experience with the battle tank during World War I.</p></p><p><p>Stephen Peter Rosen is Harvard College Professor and Beton Michael Kaneb Professor of National Security and Military Affairs at Harvard University. He is the author of <i>Societies and Military Power: India and Its Armies</i>, also from Cornell.</p><p>"Professionals interested in national security will find it hard to ignore this book.... Rosen recounts how major innovations in the twentieth century changed the way wars were fought. His underlying message is that understanding the process of innovation holds more importance to winning future wars than focusing on any particular change in weapons, organizations, or tactics.... Rosen crafts his book with a historian's eye for the facts and a political scientist&#x2019;s willingness to draw conclusions."</p> (<i>Military Review</i>)<br><br><p>"What makes for innovations in war-making? The answers of this careful study, based primarily on American military experiences in the twentieth century, run refreshingly against intuition: innovation seems easier in peacetime than war, for the fog of the latter covers all; it is no harder during periods of budgetary austerity than in flusher times; it is neither much connected to better intelligence about would-be foes nor much influenced by civilian leaders or thinkers. Those answers bear heeding now that the United States can no longer afford to build everything and then see what works."</p> (<i>Foreign Affairs</i>)</p><h2>Falling Awake</h2><p>Falling Awake offers a reflection-one for each day of the year-to encourage individuals to seek out and to find those moments of quiet and solitude in which they can attune themselves to God&#39;s quiet voice.

How she survived on the tennis court to become world No. 4. But, most importantly, how she survived her father, Damir Dokic, the tennis dad from hell. Jelena had prodigious talent, exceptional skills, a steely nerve, and an extraordinary ability to fight on the court. Off it she endured huge challenges; being an "outsider" in her new country, poverty, and racism. By 18, she was in the world's top 10. By 19, she was No. 4. The world was charmed by her and her story&#x2014;a refugee whose family had made Australia home when she was 11 years old. Jelena has not told a soul her incredible, explosive story in full&#x2014;until now. From war-torn Yugoslavia to Sydney to Wimbledon, she narrates her hellish ascent to becoming one of the best tennis players in the women&#x2019;s game, and her heartbreaking fall from the top. Her gutsy honesty will leave you in awe. Her fight back from darkness will uplift you. Most of all, Jelena's will to survive will inspire you.</p><p><b>Jelena Dokic</b>&nbsp;now spends her time mentoring young players and doing media work.&nbsp;<b>Jessica Halloran</b> is an award-winning senior sports writer with News Corp.

I&#x2019;m standing in the plush Wimbledon players&#x2019; lounge waiting, looking around for him: we&#x2019;re due to go out for a nice dinner with my managers, Ivan and John. I am seventeen years old and I have just played in the semi-finals. Of Wimbledon.</p><p>Surely, you&#x2019;d think, he would be okay that I got this far at the All England Club. You would think. At the end of the match, as I shook Lindsay&#x2019;s hand, I looked up to the stands and saw my father bolt out of his green seat, nothing but the back of his burly frame rushing from Wimbledon&#x2019;s Centre Court. Usually after my matches, he stands around somewhere near the players&#x2019; lounge and I have to find him. But today there&#x2019;s neither sight nor sound of him. I called his mobile after I finished my press duties and he didn&#x2019;t pick up.</p><p>This has been my greatest run ever in a grand slam and I want to know what he&#x2019;ll say, and to organise how we will get to dinner with Ivan and John. So I call him again, and this time, finally, he picks up.</p><p>The dull slur in his slow, loud voice tells me he is drunk. I know this tone; it&#x2019;s the tone of white wine and probably a few glasses of whisky. He is angry. Furious that I lost. His voice booms down the phone. &#x2018;You are pathetic, you are a hopeless cow, you are not to come home.</p><p>You are an embarrassment. You can&#x2019;t stay at our hotel.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;But, Dad ...&#x2019; I say quietly, trying to plead with him.</p><p>&#x2018;You need to go and find somewhere else to sleep,&#x2019; he yells at the top of his voice. &#x2018;Stay at Wimbledon and sleep there somewhere ... Or wherever else. I don&#x2019;t care.&#x2019;</p><p>He hangs up.</p><p>I have just made the semi-finals of Wimbledon. But in my father&#x2019;s eyes I am not good enough to come home.</p><p>Players around me are getting on with life, chatting, eating dinner, winding down with their coaches. I am alone and shattered. I have no money &#x2013; well, no access to it &#x2013; no credit card. It is Dad who has all that. He controls everything in my life.</p><p>Emotion starts to overwhelm me. <i>Failure &#x2013; I&#x2019;m a failure. </i>Minutes tick by, and then hours. I tuck myself away on a small couch in the corner of the players&#x2019; lounge, hoping no one notices me, and eventu- ally the place is empty.</p><p>At around 11 pm the cleaner arrives. She sees me in the corner and comes over. &#x2018;You can&#x2019;t stay here,&#x2019; she says softly.</p><p>I make the confession: &#x2018;I have nowhere to sleep tonight.&#x2019; As I say it, the reality hits me. The tears prick in the corner of my eyes</p><p>&#x2018;I have to let the tournament authorities know,&#x2019; she says.</p><p>Wimbledon&#x2019;s referee, Alan Mills, arrives. &#x2018;What happened?&#x2019; he asks gently.</p><p>&#x2018;I have nowhere to go,&#x2019; I say. &#x2018;I have nowhere to sleep.&#x2019;</p><p>Hot tears are running down my face, but I don&#x2019;t let on that my own father has banished me: as always I must protect him. Alan, however, seems to know what&#x2019;s going on. My management agency, Advantage, has rented a beautiful house in Wimbledon village; Alan calls my managers and they say they will take me in. He arranges for a tournament car to take me to the house.</p><p>I arrive sobbing and Ivan and John look concerned when they see me. They explain they&#x2019;d called my dad earlier in the evening trying to locate us, and my nine-year-old brother, Savo, answered. John says he could hear my father&#x2019;s voice in the background. Apparently Savo said simply, &#x2018;My dad isn&#x2019;t here.&#x2019;</p><p>I am both heartbroken by my father&#x2019;s rejection and embarrassed by it.</p><p>I&#x2019;m shown to the spare room. <i>At least I didn&#x2019;t get a beating from him</i>. As I wait for sleep, through the shock and hurt I start to realise that I might never make my father happy. That I might never be good enough in his eyes.</p></p><h2>Ties That Bind: Familial Homophobia and Its Consequences</h2><p>Hailed as a cri de coeur woven into a utopian vision&#x201d; by Susan Brownmiller (author of <i>Against Our Will</i>), <i>Ties That Bind</i> is the highly praised work of prizewinning writer and professor Sarah Schulman on familial homophobia,&#x201d; a phenomenon that, until now, has not had a name but is nevertheless an integral part of most people&#x2019;s experience. <i>Ties That Bind</i> invites us to understand familial homophobia as a cultural crisis, rather than a personal or an individual problem.<br> <br>Ambitious, original, and deeply important, Schulman&#x2019;s book draws on her own lived experience, her research, and her engagement with active social change to articulate a practical, attainable vision of transformation that can begin today.

Because many pastors are fearful of things they do not understand, they choose to ignore this portion of Christ's ministry. As a result, multitudes of people--including Christians--are needlessly<br> living in torment. Many contemporary pastors have rejected the idea that Christians can have a demon, thereby eliminating the section of Jesus' Great Commission that instructs believers to "<i>heal the sick</i>" and "<i>cast out demons</i>" (Matthew 10:8 NKJV). I believe that Pastor Tom Brown has answered a call to minister to the sick, afflicted, and tormented with an emphasis on the casting out of demons that is comparable to that of the New Testament church.<br><b>--Dr. Bill Basansky, Former Trustee, International Convention of Faith Ministries</b></p><h2>A Stranger&#39;s Pose</h2><p>Through stories remembered and imagined, and images by acclaimed photographers, A Stranger's Pose draws the reader into a world of encounters in more than a dozen African towns.

Dr. Paula Gunn Allen, the acknowledged founder of Native American literary studies, draws on sources often overlooked by Western historians and offers remarkable new insights into the adventurous life and sacred role of this foremost American heroine. Gunn Allen reveals why so many have revered Pocahontas as the female counterpart to the father of our nation, George Washington.</p></p><p><p>Paula Gunn Allen, Ph.D., is an American of Laguna Pueblo/Metis descent and Professor Emerita of English and American Indian Studies at UCLA. The author of many books, including the landmark title, <em>The Sacred Hoop</em>, she is credited as the founder of the field of Native American literary studies. She received a fellowship from the Ford Foundation-National Research Council to study the oral tradition in Native American literature, a writing fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts, and has also been an Associate Fellow at the Stanford Humanities Institute. She has been honored with the American Book Award from the Before Columbus Foundation, the Native American Prize for Literature, and the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Native Writer's Circle of the Americas. She lives in Fort Bragg, California.</p>In what is presented as the first study of its kind by an American Indian scholar, Allen (The Sacred Hoop) offers a corrective to the romantic story of Pocahontas told initially by Capt. John Smith of the Virginia Company and most recently by Disney Studios. Euro-American historical accounts of Pocahontas's brief life, asserts Allen, typically depict her as a lovelorn and tragic character (she died in 1617 in the aptly named river port of Gravesend, England, at the age of 20 or 21). Allen's Pocahontas, by contrast, is a real visionary, a prodigiously gifted young woman fervently devoted to the spiritual traditions of her people: a loose-knit group of Algonquin tribes known as the Powhatan Alliance, or Tsenacommacah. When the English colonists who began establishing Jamestown in 1607 invaded the Tsenacommacah, Pocahontas immediately identified it as the fulfillment of a prophecy that foretold the end of their world and the beginning of a new one, argues Allen. It was "world change time," she writes, and Pocahontas (also called Matoaka, Amonute and finally Lady Rebecca Rolfe) was nothing if not mutable-as implied by the book's subtitle. Still, notwithstanding Pocahontas's significant role in American history, Allen's claims that Pocahontas "set in motion a chain of events that would," among other things, "liberate the starving and miserable peoples of Europe and beyond" can seem overstated. More persuasive are Allen's comments about the cultural similarities between the English and Algonquin and the idea that each group changed the other. When casting Pocahontas as "the embodiment of this dual cultural transformation," her role, and the book, are at their clearest, and are made manifest by Allen's often lyrical and powerful writing.<br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>American on Purpose: The Improbable Adventures of an Unlikely Patriot</h2><p><p><strong>&#x201c;With <em>American on Purpose</em>, Craig Ferguson somehow manages to avoid the pitfalls of self-indulgence and self-importance that plague most (okay, all) Hollywood autobiographies.

We have established orbit around the frontier colony Vesbius, a settlement just outside Federation jurisdiction in the Omega sector. On the planet below is a colony of nearly 20,000 people, including many families. The conjugated orbits of the planet&#x2019;s moons have unexpectedly perturbed an asteroid and the huge rock is now on a path to strike the planet&#x2014;and destroy the colony. Although the colony is outside the Federation, the colonists are human and have strong trade and cultural ties to the Federation. Our mission is to offer assistance and support in the evacuation of Vesbius.<br> <br>The ship&#x2019;s intercom whistled and a look of resignation passed over the face of Captain James T. Kirk. He was on a treadmill in the Enterprise workout facility and was near the end of a simulated twelve-mile run to the top of Pikes Peak in Colorado. The treadmill was tilted to its steepest incline, and Kirk was sweating up a storm. He&#x2019;d done this run before, but now he was working on a personal best.<br> <br>It would have to wait. Kirk mashed the stop button and hopped off the treadmill as it was slowing down. He picked up a towel from a nearby rack and mopped his brow while pressing the button on the workout room intercom that connected him to the bridge.<br> <br>&#x201c;Kirk here,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>&#x201c;We are preparing to enter orbit around the planet Vesbius, Captain,&#x201d; said Commander Spock, who had the conn on the bridge while Kirk was away.<br> <br>&#x201c;Correct me if I&#x2019;m mistaken,&#x201d; Kirk replied, &#x201c;but I thought we weren&#x2019;t due to arrive for another twenty minutes.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It seems that what Mister Scott described as his &#x2018;wee bit of tinkering and tweaking&#x2019; on the antimatter recombination unit of the warp drive has had a beneficial effect,&#x201d; Spock responded acerbically.<br> <br>&#x201c;All right,&#x201d; said Kirk. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be right there.&#x201d;<br> <br>The captain continued to dry himself with the microbial refresher towel. He reflected that while this was not quite as good as a full bath, it would have to do for now. He pulled on his tawny gold command shirt and made his way to the turbolift.<br> <br>As soon as Kirk arrived at the bridge, Mister Spock arose from the command chair and took a position at his science station. Chekov and Sulu manned the navigator and helmsman posts, respectively, and Uhura was at the communications station.<br> <br>It was a source of great pride for Kirk to be among his crew. Three and a half years together had formed them into a well-oiled unit. But it was their individual strengths that most pleased Kirk, and humbled him. True, he&#x2019;d picked his crew carefully, but he&#x2019;d also been extraordinarily lucky to have such officers from which to choose. Now that the Enterprise&#x2019;s five-year mission was well past the halfway mark, Kirk could not help but feel a bit of nostalgia for the times he&#x2019;d shared with these people.<br> <br>Yet, as always, he had to stop himself from indulging in too much warmth and fuzziness. The mission wasn&#x2019;t over, not by a long shot, and today he and the Enterprise crew had a very important job to do.<br> <br>&#x201c;Lieutenant Uhura, open a channel to the chancellor of the Vesbius colony, please. What was his name? Vader?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Faber, sir,&#x201d; Uhura replied. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s standing by.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;On-screen,&#x201d; said Kirk.<br> <br>Uhura pressed a button. The planet, which had previously occupied the main viewscreen, was replaced by a stocky, older man. He looked to be of European stock and possessed a shock of gray in the middle of his combed-back hair. He did not have a happy expression on his face.<br> <br>&#x201c;Mister Chancellor, I&#x2019;m Captain James T. Kirk of the U.S.S. Enterprise. My ship and my crew are in orbit around your planet and are ready and able to assist you in any way.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Assist us?&#x201d; said the chancellor. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sure how you could do that. Furthermore, I have to object to the Federation sending a scientific mission our way during such a time as this. Normally we welcome Federation contact, of course. Maybe if you come back in a few months, we&#x2019;ll be better able to deal with you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Deal?&#x201d; Kirk replied. &#x201c;Mister Chancellor, are you aware that there is a very large asteroid on a collision course with your planet?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We are quite aware of that fact, Captain,&#x201d; the chancellor said. &#x201c;Which is why I am surprised that the Federation chose to send someone to look in on us at a time like this.&#x201d;<br> <br>While the chancellor was speaking, another man came into the viewscreen field. He was shorter than Faber and was dressed in what looked like the uniform of a planetary militia. His features were a blend of Asian and European. This man leaned down and whispered something into the chancellor&#x2019;s ear, and Faber nodded. The other man exited the way he had come.<br> <br>Kirk craned forward in his chair.<br> <br>Interesting, the captain thought. Was some sort of intrigue going on below on the planet surface? Had the chancellor&#x2019;s power been somehow usurped? His response to the Enterprise offer of help would be curious behavior at any time, and it was especially so now.<br> <br>&#x201c;We are not here to look in on you, Mister Chancellor,&#x201d; said Kirk emphatically. &#x201c;We are here to get you and your people off this planet.&#x201d;<br> <br>The chancellor did his best to look puzzled, but to Kirk it had the distinct appearance of a put-on expression. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m afraid there&#x2019;s been a mix-up,&#x201d; he replied. &#x201c;We requested no such assistance.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;On the contrary, sir, three months ago a direct request for assistance was delivered to Starbase Twelve via a drone messenger capsule,&#x201d; put in Spock from his science station. Kirk knew that the feed to the chancellor would automatically pull back to include the Vulcan in the visual.<br> <br>&#x201c;That drone was not authorized by the Planetary Council, however. It was sent by a group of our merchants who overreacted to the crisis before the situation was adequately understood. And be that as it may,&#x201d; said the chancellor in an officious tone, &#x201c;we no longer require any aid, and your presence is a distraction, I&#x2019;m afraid.&#x201d;<br> <br>Kirk touched his fingers to his chin and leaned back in his chair. After considering a moment, he spoke again. &#x201c;Mister Chancellor, we&#x2019;ve come a long way. I understand that Vesbius is outside Federation territory, but we are concerned for your safety nonetheless. I do have my orders. I&#x2019;d like to beam down and discuss the situation with you in person.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Captain, I really must insist&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>Kirk cut the man off. &#x201c;Chancellor, Vesbius has a reputation for its hospitality, among other things. I hope that these reports have not been mistaken.&#x201d;<br> <br>The chancellor sighed. &#x201c;Very well, Captain Kirk,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I will provide coordinates for you to beam down.&#x201d; The previous hard expression on Faber&#x2019;s face softened, and he attempted a smile. &#x201c;We really do cherish our reputation for a generous welcome here on Vesbius, Captain. We will do our best to see that it is upheld when you arrive, despite our trying circumstances. Please understand that while we are not a Federation colony, we have strong cultural and, of course, genetic ties to the Federation and to humanity. I look forward to meeting you. Faber out.&#x201d;<br> <br>The viewscreen went blank momentarily and then was replaced by the view of the planet below. Kirk shook his head. &#x201c;What was that about?&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Curious,&#x201d; said Mister Spock. &#x201c;While he refused our assistance, he did take pains to emphasize the colony&#x2019;s relationship to the Federation.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;They have strong trade ties, do they not?&#x201d; said Kirk. &#x201c;They are master biologists. Vesbian pharmaceuticals have been an enormous boon to the Federation. The lives that have been saved by that Rigelian fever vaccine alone must number in the billions. Plus, everyone in the Omega sector has heard of Vesbian ale.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I am not familiar with the substance,&#x201d; replied Mister Spock.<br> <br>&#x201c;Spock, where&#x2019;s your scientific curiosity?&#x201d; Kirk said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s some of the best beer in the galaxy, in my opinion.&#x201d;<br> <br>Sulu turned partway away from his home station and addressed them. &#x201c;If I may, Mister Spock, one taste of Vesbian ale and even a Vulcan might become a beer drinker.&#x201d; He added, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s that good.&#x201d;<br> <br>Mister Spock arched an eyebrow. &#x201c;Indeed?&#x201d; he replied.<br> <br>&#x201c;You may get your chance, Spock,&#x201d; said Kirk. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m taking you and McCoy down to Vesbius in the landing party.&#x201d; He turned to Lieutenant Uhura. &#x201c;Lieutenant, ask the doctor to join us in the transporter room.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Doctor McCoy to the transporter room,&#x201d; said Uhura into her station intercom.<br> <br>Spock cocked his head. &#x201c;Doctor McCoy is famously averse to having his atoms spread across the universe. May I inquire as to the purpose of including him in the landing party?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You may,&#x201d; Kirk replied with a sly smile. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s because of something Faber said just now&#x2014;that statement about strong cultural and genetic ties to humanity. We may need the doctor.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sir,&#x201d; Spock replied.<br> <br>&#x201c;Besides,&#x201d; said Kirk, &#x201c;I had an image of the three of us raising tankards of ale and getting pleasantly sloshed together in a Vesbian beer garden.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Unlikely, Captain,&#x201d; said Spock. &#x201c;Alcohol does not have the same effect on Vulcans as it does upon humans, where it loosens the inhibitions and serves as a social lubricant. For Vulcans, it merely quiets the mind and heightens the analytic side of our nature.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Great,&#x201d; Chekov muttered to himself. &#x201c;Having a drink makes him even more of a logical stick in the mud than he already is.&#x201d;<br> <br>Kirk noticed that Spock, who had obviously heard the comment with his keen ears, betrayed no sign of irritation. In fact, if Kirk had not known better, he might have believed that he saw the slightest trace of amusement cross Spock&#x2019;s calm and composed expression.<br> <br>A bleat from the bridge intercom interrupted Kirk&#x2019;s reflection.<br> <br>&#x201c;McCoy here,&#x201d; said the voice over the speaker. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m standing by in the transporter room. Since you are bound and determined to throw my molecules across space, why don&#x2019;t you get down here, and let&#x2019;s get on with it.&#x201d;<br> <br>Kirk stood up and motioned to Spock. &#x201c;Shall we join the doctor? Lieutenant Uhura, call Scotty to the bridge. Until he arrives, Mister Sulu, you have the conn.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Aye, Captain,&#x201d; Sulu replied.<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>&#x201c;About time you got here,&#x201d; said Doctor Leonard McCoy when Kirk and Spock entered the transporter room. &#x201c;Now maybe you can explain to me what&#x2019;s going on.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The Vesbians are refusing our aid to evacuate the planet,&#x201d; said Spock. &#x201c;In fact, there are no indications that an evacuation has begun.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; replied a surprised McCoy. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t they realize what&#x2019;s about to happen?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, they realize it, Doctor,&#x201d; said Kirk. &#x201c;But I think there&#x2019;s something fishy going on down there, and I want you along to help us find out what it is.&#x201d;<br> <br>The three men stepped onto the transporter platform. McCoy nodded. &#x201c;I would like to know what&#x2019;s so damn important to make twenty thousand people play chicken with an asteroid.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;As far as we know, domesticated fowl have nothing to do with the situation, Doctor.&#x201d;<br> <br>McCoy eyed Spock to see whether or not the Vulcan was having him on. As usual, it was impossible to tell. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll say they don&#x2019;t,&#x201d; McCoy replied.<br> <br>&#x201c;Gentlemen, let&#x2019;s find out.&#x201d; Kirk nodded to the transporter technician. &#x201c;Energize.&#x201d;<br> <br>With a shimmer of dissolving atomic structure the landing party disappeared from the platform.<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>The landing party materialized on a wide stone veranda atop a hill that overlooked a broad plain. Rolling fields of grain stretched as far as the eye could see below them in the valley. Interspersed among the fields were a variety of farmhouses and storage structures. The farmhouses looked to be two-story buildings and resembled Swiss or Austrian chalets, with their wood and wattle construction. Winding brooks and larger streams cut through the landscape and reflected the pure blue of the Vesbian sky. Cobblestone lanes and a few wide roads connected the farmhouses.<br> <br>In the far distance were craggy, snowcapped mountains. The temperature on the veranda where they stood was comfortable, if a bit chilly, and fresh in comparison to the controlled atmosphere of the Enterprise. All in all, reflected Kirk, Vesbius looked like an incredibly pleasant place to live&#x2014;at least at this latitude in the northern hemisphere. Behind them was what seemed to be a complex of office buildings. The architecture was modern Federation, but it clearly had Bavarian and Swiss influence from Earth.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; said McCoy, taking a look around, &#x201c;a person could get used to living in a paradise like this. It&#x2019;s a shame it can&#x2019;t last.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; said Kirk. &#x201c;It is a great shame.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Captain Kirk?&#x201d;<br> <br>The captain looked around. A group was emerging from one of the office buildings, which Kirk supposed were the colony&#x2019;s government center. One of the group he recognized as Chancellor Faber. Another, a shorter man than Faber, was the person who had whispered into Faber&#x2019;s ear earlier. There were two very tall, very brawny fellows accompanying them. One might take them for a security detail, but Kirk didn&#x2019;t want to jump to conclusions at this point.<br> <br>And standing next to Faber was a strikingly pretty woman. She was young&#x2014;Kirk guessed she was in her late twenties or early thirties&#x2014;and statuesque. As she drew closer, Kirk noticed that she had light blue eyes that matched the blue of the Vesbian sky. He&#x2019;d never seen eyes quite that color before. Kirk found it compelling, and&#x2014;<br> <br>Almost uncanny, he thought.<br> <br>&#x201c;Mister Chancellor,&#x201d; he said, turning to face the welcoming committee. &#x201c;My ship astronomers estimate that the asteroid that is on its way toward your planet is due to arrive in under thirty days. Since it is headed on an almost direct collision vector with Vesbius, perhaps you have been unable to accurately gauge its velocity. This is the only reason I can think of to explain why we have detected no signs of a planetary evacuation.&#x201d;<br> <br>Chancellor Faber stood before the landing party with his hands clasped at his waist. He was worrying them together, as if under tension, Kirk noticed. But his voice did not betray any stress. &#x201c;The reason you have detected no signs of evacuation, Captain, is because there are none,&#x201d; Faber stated. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re not leaving Vesbius. We have decided, instead, to dig in.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Unwise,&#x201d; said Mister Spock. &#x201c;The vast energies that the strike will unleash are immense. But these will pale beside the after effects&#x2014;which will almost certainly be most deleterious to life. Consider what happened to the dinosaurs of Earth.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, I know,&#x201d; replied Chancellor Faber. &#x201c;But this is not Earth, and we are no longer Earth men.&#x201d; He nodded toward the office complex. &#x201c;Gentlemen, please come in and refresh yourselves. We have prepared a table for you, and, though I am very busy at the moment, it would be our pleasure to join you for a while.&#x201d; Faber smiled at the young woman standing near him, and this time Kirk detected only pleasure in his expression. &#x201c;I would like to introduce you to my daughter, Hannah, as well, who will be joining us. She is the executive branch chief advisor for intra-colony affairs.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The pleasure is ours,&#x201d; said Kirk, and he meant it.<br> <br>They sat down at a large table that was made from the local variant of oak and were served by a staff of cooks and waiters.<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t any of these people know what&#x2019;s about to fall on them?&#x201d; said McCoy sotto voce to Kirk and Spock.<br> <br>&#x201c;Doctor, I believe they ...</p><h2>Helping Others Overcome Addictions: How God&#39;s Grace Brings Lasting Freedom</h2><p><p><i>Does Christianity have an answer for addiction?</i> As longtime pastor Mike Quarles&#x2019;s alcoholism worsened over eight years, churches and Christians referred him to treatment, 12-Step programs, therapy...nothing worked.

As historian and legal scholar Patrick J. Charles shows, what the right to arms means to Americans, as well as what it legally protects, has changed drastically since its first appearance in the 1689 Declaration of Rights.Armed in America explores how and why the right to arms transformed at different points in history. The right was initially meant to serve as a parliamentary right of resistance, yet by the ratification of the Second Amendment in 1791 the right had become indispensably intertwined with civic republicanism. As the United States progressed into the 19th century the right continued to change--this time away from civic republicanism and towards the individual-right understanding that is known today, albeit with the important caveat that the right could be severely restricted by the government&#39;s police power. Throughout the 20th century this understanding of the right remained the predominant view. But working behind the scenes was the beginnings of the gun-rights movement--a movement that was started in the early 20th century through the collective efforts of sporting magazine editors and was eventually commandeered by the National Rifle Association to become the gun-rights movement known today.Readers looking to sort through the shrill rhetoric surrounding the current gun debate and arrive at an informed understanding of the legal and historical development of the right to arms will find this book to be an invaluable resource.</p><p><b>Patrick J.

It is a history that has become guided by political ideology and cultural attitudes more so than facts. With the advent of the Internet and the proliferation of &#x201c;fake news,&#x201d; it is not surprising that the history of gun rights, or the history of any subject for that matter, is undergoing a factual crisis. What makes the history of gun rights unique is that the dispute has been ongoing for four decades. The point to be made is that what is often characterized as the history of gun rights is not really history at all, at least as understood by historians. Rather, it is a historically based narrative that is researched, written, and disseminated with two objectives in mind. The first is to reinforce the political and cultural views of the gun-rights community. The second is to convince those outside the community, and hopefully the courts in the process, that the history of gun rights is not all that different from other constitutional rights, such as the First Amendment freedoms of speech, assembly, and a free press.<br><br>This brief synopsis on the history of gun rights, although intellectually critical, is not something that I write because I am anti-gun, anti-Second Amendment, associated with communism or socialism, unfamiliar with firearms, or some other negative stereotype used in contemporary gun-rights literature to &#x201c;pigeon hole&#x201d; anyone who does not wholly subscribe to the tenets of gun-rights theology. My intention is solely to write a history in a manner that adheres to accepted historical methodology and objectivity norms. What this otherwise means is a history that is written in a manner that&#x2014;to borrow from late historian Barbara W. Tuchman&#x2014;stays &#x201c;within the evidence.&#x201d; A historian should never &#x201c;invent anything, [not] even the weather.&#x201d;<br><br>For almost a decade, I have researched, written, debated, and discussed the history of gun rights, as well as the potential legal ramifications of said history. Over that time, I must admit that my attitude on the subject has changed. Initially, I viewed the history of gun rights with a sense of intellectual idealism, or one might say intellectual na�vet�. I believed that most of the legal academics that took part in framing this history did so because they were interested in learning about the past for the sake of learning about the past, and therefore were searching to find objective truths. It was with this intellectual idealism that I wrote my first book on the subject.<br><br>The book, as well as my interest in the history of gun rights, was stimulated by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia&#x2019;s 2007 decision <i>Parker v. District of Columbia</i>, where a 2&#x2013;1 majority held that the history surrounding the Second Amendment&#x2019;s ratification conveys that the right to &#x201c;keep and bear arms&#x201d; was understood by the Founding Fathers to protect an individual right to own common-use weapons for use outside of the militia. Although I was just a law student at the time, and I must admit ill-prepared to fully grapple with all the legal complexities of the opinion, my background, training, and education on the history of the American Revolution and Early Republic led me to conclude that the historical analysis in the decision reflected one of three things: I was either completely misinformed on the history of the American Revolution and Early Republic, there was a sublayer of gun-rights history virtually unknown to historians and therefore the general public, or the historical pronouncements in the opinion were inaccurate.<br><br>In order to test the accuracy of the <i>Parker</i> court&#x2019;s historical pronouncements, I read every primary source and secondary source on the ratification of the Second Amendment that I could find. This historical examination, while enlightening and informative, did not provide me with much closure other than the sense that the Second Amendment was tied to the larger constitutional debate over a federalized militia. Unsatisfied, I postulated another approach to test the <i>Parker </i>court&#x2019;s central historical pronouncement. If, in fact, the court was correct that the Founding Fathers understood the term &#x201c;bear arms&#x201d; to mean carry arms, there would be plenty of examples in late-eighteenth-century literature. In the end, my historical examination turned up nothing of substance to support the <i>Parker</i> court&#x2019;s central historical pronouncement. In almost every instance, the terms &#x201c;bear arms&#x201d; was used in a distinctive military context. While there were indeed a few outliers that used the term &#x201c;bear arms&#x201d; broadly, there was nothing in them to firmly suggest that &#x201c;bear arms&#x201d; was referring to the general carrying of arms for non-military-related purposes.<br><br>Still, I thought that there surely had to be something more in the evidentiary record that supported the <i>Parker</i> court&#x2019;s historical pronouncements, and I postulated a legal-centric linguistic approach to the historical problem. Given that the Constitution and Bill of Rights were for all intents and purposes legal documents, drafted, debated, and amended by some of the late-eighteenth-century&#x2019;s greatest legal minds, then surely the language used to comprise the Second Amendment would be found in the very laws governing eighteenth-century Americans. For three months, I was immersed in eighteenth-century law books. Upon finishing my research, I came to two historical conclusions: in eighteenth-century militia laws, all of the language that comprised the Second Amendment&#x2014;&#x201c;well-regulated militia,&#x201d; &#x201c;necessary to the security of a free state,&#x201d; &#x201c;bear arms,&#x201d; and &#x201c;keep arms&#x201d;&#x2014;appeared regularly. Conversely, in all the other eighteenth-century laws, including the laws pertaining to crime, self-defense, weapons, and hunting, none of the language that comprised the Second Amendment was present&#x2014;not even different variants of the term &#x201c;bear arms&#x201d;&#x2014;i.e. &#x201c;to bear arms&#x201d;, &#x201c;bearing arms,&#x201d; etc. Even more telling was the fact that not one eighteenth-century legal commentator or one eighteenth-century legal case used the term &#x201c;bear arms&#x201d; or any variant of the terms to describe the act of carrying arms or using arms in the act of self-defense. These findings led me to conclude that the Second Amendment was neither legally intended nor legally understood by the Founding Fathers as protecting a right to armed individual self-defense. Rather, the Second Amendment was intimately tied to service in a well-regulated militia, and the political history surrounding the militia, particularly from the late eighteenth century to the early nineteenth century, further supported this conclusion.<br><br>It was during the process of organizing my historical findings into a book manuscript that the Supreme Court of the United States granted certiorari in the <i>Parker</i> case and ultimately ruled in favor of the armed individual self-defense interpretation, albeit by a slim 5&#x2013;4 majority. Like the <i>Parker </i>court, the Supreme Court&#x2019;s decision, docketed as<i> District of Columbia v. Heller</i>, was centered on history in law. What immediately stood out from the decision was the majority&#x2019;s linguistic analysis. With only a few working examples, the majority agreed that the minority usage of the term &#x201c;bear arms&#x201d; was the majority usage, and the majority usage was somehow the minority usage. What also stood out was the manner in which the majority explained away the Second Amendment&#x2019;s prefatory language, as if the Founding Fathers had included it as merely a visual aesthetic.<br><br>In the months that followed, I modified the manuscript to include the Supreme Court&#x2019;s opinion in <i>Heller</i>, and, because the Supreme Court would eventually be faced with a case on Second Amendment incorporation&#x2014;that is, whether the Second Amendment applied equally to the federal and state governments&#x2014;I predicted that the historical dispute over the meaning and scope of the Second Amendment was far from over and would perhaps be corrected by a later court. Until that time, state and local government firearms controls were immune from the <i>Heller</i> opinion.<br><br>Once the book was complete, I became curious about another historical pronouncement made by the <i>Heller</i> majority&#x2014;that the English antecedents of the Second Amendment, particularly Article VII of the 1689 English Declaration of Rights, was understood as conferring a right to armed individual self-defense. Given my previous undergraduate exposure to the history of Stuart England, the history surrounding the English Declaration of Rights was a subject I was familiar with. Still, in striving for historical objectivity and accuracy, I reached out to historians who specialized in Stuart England and seventeenth-century English intellectual thought. With their guidance, much like I had when researching origins of the Second Amendment, I read every source that was available pertaining to the English Declaration of Rights and compared my findings with what the <i>Heller</i> majority historically pronounced. What I found was that the actual history of the English Declaration of Rights and the history embraced by the <i>Heller</i> majority were far removed from one another. They were not even close, and the reason for the historical divide was the works of two influential scholars, Joyce Lee Malcolm and Stephen P. Halbrook, both of whom maintain ties to the National Rifle Association (NRA).<br><br>Page by page, line by line, footnote by footnote, I delved into the relevant historical material written by Malcolm and Halbrook, and in the process found a number of errors. By and large, Malcolm&#x2019;s and Halbrook&#x2019;s errors were due to their failure to fully adhere to accepted historical methodologies. Historical texts were not fully contextualized, broad historical claims were made with little supporting evidence, historical research and historical analysis were conducted for the sake of conducting a modern legal thought experiment, not uncovering the past nor accepting the past on its own terms, and so forth, and so forth. At times, Malcolm and Halbrook made historical claims without any supporting evidence, such as Malcolm&#x2019;s claim that James II sought to use the 1671 Game Act to disarm all of England or Halbrook&#x2019;s claim that the Second Amendment was drafted in response to the disarmament that took place during the Revolutionary War.<br><br>The alarming gravity of these historical errors were the impetus for my next two publications, both of which concluded that the history of the Second Amendment, that is an objective and thoroughly research history of the Second Amendment, did not pass the constitutional test for incorporation. This line of argument, as well as the historical research and historical analysis supporting it, ended up being basis for an amicus brief when the Supreme Court was presented with a Second Amendment incorporation case. Docketed as <i>McDonald v. City of Chicago</i>, the Supreme Court ultimately incorporated the Second Amendment, and did so by affirming most of the historical pronouncements made by the <i>Heller</i> majority, but not without Justice Stephen Breyer adopting my legal argument and writing a scathing dissent on the use and abuse of history.<br><br>In the months immediately following <i>McDonald</i>, as I witnessed lawyer after lawyer, and legal scholar after legal scholar, most of whom were paid for or employed by gun-rights advocacy organizations, continue to distort the history of the Second Amendment, my intellectual idealism eventually shifted to intellectual realism. The history of gun rights was not based on adhering to accepted historical principles, such as historical objectivity, the search for the historical truth, or a scholarly exchange of ideas. Rather, the history of gun rights was principled on legal advocacy, political activism, and in the process expanding the meaning and scope of the Second Amendment as broadly as possible.<br><br>For a brief time, given the dishonest nature of the subject, I considered foregoing any additional historical research, writings, debates or discussions on the history of gun rights. Why continue to take part in an academic discussion if your opponents and critics do not adhere to the same academic norms and methodological standards? Why continue to search for historical truth if your opponents and critics do not acknowledge their errors? Before making a decision I spoke with some legal and historical colleagues. What I took away from these discussions was that if I turned my back on the history of gun rights I would be turning my back on arguably the principle reason I wanted to be a historian in the first place&#x2014;protecting history and facts from myth and distortion.<br><br>My post-<i>McDonald</i> publications on the history of gun rights were written in line with this guiding principle. In publication after publication, I tested some of the most common historical pronouncements made by gun-rights scholars. In virtually every instance, the historical evidence led to one of two conclusions. The historical pronouncements were either ill-founded or based on rudimentary research methods. The findings in my post-<i>McDonald</i> publications led me to examine when and how such unsupported historical pronouncements came into existence. Over the same period of time, although I was (and remain) extremely critical of the <i>Heller</i> majority&#x2019;s acceptance of these unsupported historical pronouncements, as a legal theorist I endorsed <i>Heller</i>&#x2019;s core holding&#x2014;armed individual self-defense in the home with common-use weapons. In my mind, although the impetus for the Second Amendment&#x2019;s ratification was not armed individual self-defense, as a matter of history in law, it is undisputable that the castle doctrine was a fixture in late-eighteenth-century jurisprudence. This fact, accompanied by a long tradition of firearms ownership and use, was in my mind historically sufficient to jurisprudentially recognize a right to armed self-defense in the home.<br><br>As the 2014 elections approached, putting the politics of gun rights front and center, I developed an academic interest in the politicization of gun rights. How did the Supreme Court&#x2019;s decisions in <i>Heller</i> and <i>McDonald</i> affect the public and political discourse? How did the concept of gun rights become politically aligned with conservatism? And how did the view of Second Amendment absolutism&#x2014;the belief that any regulation, no matter how minor, on the ownership, use, or availability of firearms is an unconstitutional infringement of the right to arms&#x2014;become prevalent in the public and political discourse?<br><br>Searching for the answers to these questions only led to more questions, and more questions, to the point that I identified a large gap in the history of gun rights. No historical study, other than literature and publications distributed by gun-rights organizations, had fully explored the political development of gun rights, as well as their evolution, within the American discourse. Indeed, a number of independent studies claimed that the modern gun-rights movement was born out the turbulent 1960s. However, within these studies there was considerable lack of primary source material, and the secondary sources relied upon were not all that historically convincing from a methodological standpoint. Equally concerning in these studies was how decades of history were easily glossed over in just a few pages.<br><br>Sensing something was historically amiss, I began testing these claims, looking to identify when, how, and why gun-rights politics began to develop. Instead of searching for evidence in the 1960s and working backward, I started at the mid-nineteenth century and worked forward. This allowed me to better identify any ideological, social, and cultural changes that took place in either the public, political, or legal disco...</p><h2>Paradigm Shift: 7 Realities of Success in the New Economy</h2><p>A paradigm shift is a sudden, major change in the way you view something, brought on by new information or a new detail that was formerly unknown.

I imagined generations of gardeners leaving a horticultural blueprint for me to follow, but as spring turned to summer and no bulbs or peony nubs had emerged, I saw that I had more or less a blank slate: almost two acres populated with old trees, overgrown shrubs, and large lawns. With mixed feelings (panic, excitement!) I turned to books and classes for education and inspiration, and I soon found that by visiting other gardens I could observe and learn about new plant varieties and advantageous plant combinations, as well as garden design techniques and cultural practices.<br><br>My thirst for gardening knowledge has only increased since then. I annually visit about 15 gardens--on organized garden tours, vacations, business trips, and even college campus tours. I enjoy returning to many of the same gardens and estates year after year. Observing a landscape during different seasons and weather conditions--even at different times of day--yields valuable lessons that I can take home to my own garden.&nbsp;<br><br>And I have found I am not alone! Friends and relatives--even non-gardeners--who've accompanied me on my garden jaunts enthusiastically volunteer to come again. This seems to be part of a growing trend throughout the United States and worldwide. University of Connecticut professor Richard W. Benfield, author of&nbsp;<i>Garden Tourism</i>, estimates that 100 million people visited U.S. public gardens in 2016--more than to Las Vegas and Orlando combined. When asked their top reasons for visiting gardens, his survey participants said: to be outdoors, to enjoy beauty, to relieve stress, and to enjoy being with others.<br><br>The Northeast is seeing an exciting resurgence in garden creation and restoration. The Coastal Maine Botanical Gardens is the brainchild of locals who believed northern New England needed a botanical garden. New Jersey's Greenwood Gardens and such grand Massachusetts estates as Edith Wharton's The Mount, The Crane Estate, and Naumkeag recently have been restored to their Gilded Age glory with the generous and enthusiastic support of private donors. The Garden Conservancy has been invaluable in preserving private gardens for public enjoyment, and a growing number of important landscapes have been designated as National Historic Landmarks.&nbsp;<br><br>Robert Page, director of the Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation at the National Park Service, says the idea of what makes for a culturally important landscape is alsochanging.He points to the resurrection of a two-acre vegetable garden at FDR's estate, Springwood, and a plan to restore the views along the roads in Acadia National Park. "Things are happening in parks and gardens that [would have] seemed really grand a while ago."<br><br>This book is a virtual garden tour of large public gardens, historic estates, inspiring private gardens, and destination nurseries from Maine through New England to New York's Hudson River Valley, eastern Pennsylvania, and New Jersey. It's a personal tour, and no doubt some of you will be saddened not to find a favorite garden here. I particularly enjoy discovering small home nurseries born of a gardener's initial fascination with a particular plant, and I find that visiting historic homes with preserved gardens gives me a sense of stepping back in time. Gardens that incorporate art, sculpture, or music demonstrate the imagination and possibilities that can define the holistic horticultural experience.<br><br>Gardens truly are reflections of their creators. Many large public gardens such as Longwood Gardens and the New York Botanical Garden were initially born of their founder's passion for plants. Talk with the current owners and caretakers and learn something new. This guide includes an introduction to some of the extraordinary individuals who took their passion for horticulture and created a retreat that others can enjoy for years to come.<br><br>&nbsp;<br>While many of these gardens were built by wealthy landowners, they owe their continued existence to volunteers. Few estates can now afford the staff required to maintain these landscapes, relying on a small army of volunteers, many of whom have given their hard work and knowledge for more than 30 years. It is with gratitude and appreciation that I visit these special places. I hope to inspire you to experience many of these beautiful destinations on your own.In The Garden Tourist, Milbocker not only provides readers with a sensory-filled description of each garden, but also the architecture of the site and its history.

In what ways is the presence of these newcomers complicating efforts to organize for workplace justice? <i>Scratching Out a Living</i> takes readers deep into Mississippi&#x2019;s chicken processing plants and communities, where large numbers of Latin American migrants were recruited in the mid-1990s to labor alongside an established African American workforce in some of the most dangerous and lowest-paid jobs in the country. As America&#x2019;s voracious appetite for chicken has grown, so has the industry&#x2019;s reliance on immigrant workers, whose structural position makes them particularly vulnerable to exploitation.<br><br> Based on the author&#x2019;s six years of collaboration with a local workers&#x2019; center, this book explores how Black, white, and new Latino Mississippians have lived and understood these transformations. Activist anthropologist Angela Stuesse argues that people&#x2019;s racial identifications and relationships to the poultry industry prove vital to their interpretations of the changes they are experiencing. Illuminating connections between the area&#x2019;s long history of racial inequality, the industry&#x2019;s growth and drive to lower labor costs, immigrants&#x2019; contested place in contemporary social relations, and workers&#x2019; prospects for political mobilization, <i>Scratching Out a Living</i> paints a compelling ethnographic portrait of neoliberal globalization and calls for organizing strategies that bring diverse working communities together in mutual construction of a more just future.</p><p>"This richly textured ethnography excavates the complex relations among Southern whites, African Americans, and Latino immigrants in Mississippi&#x2019;s poultry industry and the surrounding community. Angela Stuesse vividly documents the history of the industry, its restructuring over recent decades, the abuses workers experience daily in the plants, and the labor-organizing efforts that she participated in and observed. This is an exemplary work of politically engaged scholarship that offers a wealth of insight into the thorny dynamics of race and immigration in the New South." &#x2014;Ruth Milkman, author of <i>L.A. Story: Immigrant Workers and the Future of the U.S. Labor Movement</i><br><br> &#x201c;<i>Scratching Out a Living </i>is a marvelous book, a tour de force that deftly blends interpretive ethnography, engaged scholarship, and critical race theory. It combines a fascinating and compelling ethnography of how Latino immigration to central Mississippi has transformed the racial order of that region with a complex, creative, and critical analysis of how neoliberal strategies of labor recruitment and labor control require contemporary antisubordination social movements to mobilize around the dynamics of difference as well as around solidarities of sameness." &#x2014;George Lipsitz, author of <i>How Racism Takes Place</i><br><br> "This powerhouse ethnography of labor and race relations in the Deep South brings into focus the most pressing social issues of our time: unauthorized migration and the persistence of white supremacy and racism in the United States. Drawing on six years of activist anthropology in Mississippi&#x2019;s poultry industry, Angela Stuesse skillfully debunks myths about labor shortages as a cause of migration and animosity between groups of low-wage workers, showing that sustained effort to understand larger structural inequalities by groups equally destabilized by global neoliberal labor formations can build solidarity and boost efforts for change." &#x2014;Alyshia G�lvez, Associate Professor and Director of the Jaime Lucero Mexican Studies Institute at the City University of New York<br><br> "Angela Stuesse shows in vivid detail how immigrants are learning to live together, not always smoothly, under the trying conditions of poultry production, structural racism, and the criminalization of migration. <i>Scratching Out a Living</i> is a poignant example of social change and the need to move beyond hyperbolic political rhetoric to find solutions that benefit workers and their families while facilitating smooth integration into local communities." &#x2014;Leo R. Chavez, author of <i>Covering Immigration: Popular Images and the Politics of the Nation</i><br><br> "This pathbreakingly nuanced and readable account of change in the U.S. South covers all the hot button topics, from immigrant arrival and reception to workplace harassment, housing issues, and race relations between Latinos, African Americans, and whites.<i> Scratching Out a Living</i> is the best case study out there in its richness and thoroughness &#x2013; but it also transcends the entire case study model in its breadth, making a particular part of the world speak to larger issues.

Schools fall short of the mark while roads and bridges fall into disrepair. Health care costs too much and delivers too little. Budgets bleed red ink as the cost of services citizens want outstrips the taxes they are willing to pay. <i>Collaborative Governance</i> is the first book to offer solutions by demonstrating how government at every level can engage the private sector to overcome seemingly insurmountable problems and achieve public goals more effectively.</p><br><p> John Donahue and Richard Zeckhauser show how the public sector can harness private expertise to bolster productivity, capture information, and augment resources. The authors explain how private engagement in public missions--rightly structured and skillfully managed--is not so much an alternative to government as the way smart government ought to operate. The key is to carefully and strategically grant discretion to private entities, whether for-profit or nonprofit, in ways that simultaneously motivate and empower them to create public value. Drawing on a host of real-world examples-including charter schools, job training, and the resurrection of New York's Central Park--they show how, when, and why collaboration works, and also under what circumstances it doesn't.</p><br><br><p> <i>Collaborative Governance</i> reveals how the collaborative approach can be used to tap the resourcefulness and entrepreneurship of the private sector, and improvise fresh, flexible solutions to today's most pressing public challenges.</p></p><p><p>"This new and insightful work by Donahue and Zeckhauser argues that many of our most important national problems cannot best be solved by government policies or programs alone, nor can they be solved by the private sector alone. Rather, they should be approached as genuine collaborations between government and the private sector, collaborations where there is true sharing of discretion between the parties. The book is full of interesting and compelling examples of such collaboration, drawn from education, urban policy, national security, and beyond, some of which were very successful and some much less so. Analyzing these examples and cases, the book provides a detailed and useful range of prescriptions for government as it pursues these collaborative efforts. The book generalizes beyond these case examples and prescriptions and develops a new conceptual framework for considering and designing collaborations. Surely genuine government-private collaborations will increasingly be one of the most important ways we approach many of our most pressing problems, and this new book makes a vital contribution to understanding and promoting these creative efforts."<b>--Jay O. Light, dean emeritus, Harvard Business School</b></p><p>"Government vs. the market was the central subject in the twentieth-century debates. How best to combine public and private sector efforts to meet the needs of citizens is the key subject for the twenty-first century. Zeckhauser and Donahue's important book will define this debate for years to come. It should be read by anyone in the public sector who wants to work with the private sector and anyone in the private sector who wants to work with the public sector."<b>--Lawrence H. Summers, Charles W. Eliot University Professor, Harvard University</b></p><p>"This book intrigued me. All the principles of this pioneering subject are illustrated here with crisp case studies, which makes for happy reading. These authors know how to write."<b>--Thomas C. Schelling, Nobel Prize-winning economist</b></p><p>"Government can't solve all our problems. But nor can the private sector. Public-private collaborations--through which government pursues public missions by engaging private players--can be an important part of any solution. In this lucid and thoughtful book, John D. Donahue and Richard J. Zeckhauser explain how they work, why and under what circumstances they work best, and how policymakers have successfully blended private-sector efficiencies with public accountability. Using real-world examples drawn from policy domains as diverse as education, economic development, and health and safety, the authors describe the many advantages of collaboration and also clarify the pitfalls. The result is a wonderfully readable and useful account of how private incentives can be used to achieve public goals."<b>--Robert B. Reich, University of California, Berkeley</b></p><p>"This insightful book will stimulate a rethinking of the respective roles of private and public action. Donahue and Zeckhauser draw from an incredibly rich set of case studies that illustrate both the strengths and potential pitfalls of collaboration. Until now, there has been no formal articulation of the kinds of principles that this book provides for guiding policy. A genuine pleasure to read."<b>--W. Kip Viscusi, author of <i>Smoke-Filled Rooms: A Postmortem on the Tobacco Deal</i></b></p><p>"<i>Collaborative Governance</i> fills a yawning gap in the literature on collaboration and partnerships. This book achieves the gold standard for excellent writing, case selection, and presentation. The cases are interesting and cover a wide range of policy arenas. The conceptual points are made with a convincing but gentle touch."<b>--Paul L. Posner, George Mason University</b></p><b>John D. Donahue</b> and <b>Richard J.

An Introduction provides essential historical and cultural background and discusses the author's literary and linguistic innovations. Maps, a glossary of terms, and seventy-five of Guaman Poma's ink drawings are also included.</p></p><p><p>David Frye is Adjunct Professor of Anthropology, University of Michigan.</p><p>David Frye achieves a <i>tour de force</i> in rendering the chronicle comprehensible to a large audience without diminishing its richness as an historical source. The different sections of this book respect the chronicle's original composition and translate Guaman Poma's main argument with accuracy. . . . Frye's translation . . . offers a vivid portrayal of Peru's colonial society with its different strata, revealing the intricate nature of indigeneity and gender in the Andes following the Spanish conquest. . . . [T]he English text is fluid throughout. This fluidity, however, neither stifles Guaman Poma's voice nor tones down his zeal in condemning the brutality and inequity of the colonial system. Frye's achievement undoubtedly leans on his comprehension of the literary and historical context that surrounds the mestizo author, a context he summarizes in the introduction. Punctuated by knowledgeable annotations throughout the pages and complemented by a glossary of Pre-Hispanic and colonial terms, this translation proves to be a valuable contribution for introducing students to the Andean society of the colonial era. --<i>Bulletin of Latin American Research</i></p><br><br><p>David Frye is a professional anthropologist and skilled translator. [This book] includes an Introduction which provides most of the information needed to understand Guaman Poma de Ayala's text and Frye's translation thereof, a map, a glossary, an index, and generally helpful notes that demonstrate a solid command of the relevant primary and secondary literature. The sections of the lengthy manuscript . . . selected for translation are representative of the work as a whole. . . . Frye also includes some of Guaman Poma de Ayala's several hundred black-and-white drawings, which should be viewed as an integral, not merely supplementary, part of his work. . . . [T]his is a welcome translation, all the more so because it is well done. . . . Frye has been painstaking in his explanation of terminology. I recommend this work for courses on Latin America during the colonial period, or more specifically the Central Andes (i.e., Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia). --<i>Hispanic American Historical Review</i></p><br><br><p>Generations of scholars have grappled with the challenge of interpreting the person and project of the native Andean chronicler Felipe Guaman Poma de Ayala. This abridged English translation of Guaman Poma's <i>Nueva cor�nica y buen gobierno</i> represents at least two accomplishments. First, it brings this person and project to many readers for the first time. And, second, the words allow for new encounters with the possibilities in this text. These words have a piercing directness that cannot be denied, and they will jar even seasoned scholars, who thought they knew Guaman Poma. Frye has made judicious choices about inclusion, he has consulted widely, he has not shied away from the transformations that were part of being authentically native Andean in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, and he has wisely refused to fill the telling silences left by the author himself. Most significantly of all, for students and teachers, is that--in as much as it is possible--he has allowed Felipe Guaman Poma to speak for himself. --Kenneth Mills, University of Toronto</p></p><h2>A People and a Nation, Volume II: Since 1865</h2><p>Think history is dull?

B. Sevart, Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Wichita<br>"An extremely useful textbook for both formal classes and for self-study." &#x2014; Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics<br>Engineers often do not have time to take a course in complex variable theory as undergraduates, yet is is one of the most important and useful branches of mathematics, with many applications in engineering. This text is designed to remedy that need by supplying graduate engineering students (especially electrical engineering) with a course in the basic theory of complex variables, which in turn is essential to the understanding of transform theory. Presupposing a good knowledge of calculus, the book deals lucidly and rigorously with important mathematical concepts, striking an ideal balance between purely mathematical treatments that are too general for the engineer, and books of applied engineering which may fail to stress significant mathematical ideas.<br>The text is divided into two basic parts: The first part (Chapters 1&#x2013;7) is devoted to the theory of complex variables and begins with an outline of the structure of system analysis and an explanation of basic mathematical and engineering terms. Chapter 2 treats the foundation of the theory of a complex variable, centered around the Cauchy-Riemann equations. The next three chapters &#x2014; conformal mapping, complex integration, and infinite series &#x2014; lead up to a particularly important chapter on multivalued functions, explaining the concepts of stability, branch points, and riemann surfaces. Numerous diagrams illustrate the physical applications of the mathematical concepts involved.<br>The second part (Chapters 8&#x2013;16) covers Fourier and Laplace transform theory and some of its applications in engineering, beginning with a chapter on real integrals. Three important chapters follow on the Fourier integral, the Laplace integral (one-sided and two-sided) and convolution integrals. After a chapter on additional properties of the Laplace integral, the book ends with four chapters (13&#x2013;16) on the application of transform theory to the solution of ordinary linear integrodifferential equations with constant coefficients, impulse functions, periodic functions, and the increasingly important Z transform. <br>Dr. LePage's book is unique in its coverage of an unusually broad range of topics difficult to find in a single volume, while at the same time stressing fundamental concepts, careful attention to details and correct use of terminology. An extensive selection of interesting and valuable problems follows each chapter, and an excellent bibliography recommends further reading. Ideal for home study or as the nucleus of a graduate course, this useful, practical, and popular (8 printings in its hardcover edition) text offers students, engineers, and researchers a careful, thorough grounding in the math essential to many areas of engineering.

Hundert's Introduction places Mandeville in a number of eighteenth-century debates--particularly that of the nature and morality of commercial modernity--and underscores the degree to which his work stood as a central problem, not only for his immediate English contemporaries, but for such philosophers as Hume, Rousseau, and Kant. The selections are substantive enough to faithfully represent Mandeville the social theorist, and compact enough to be used in courses that can afford to spend no more than a week on his work.</p></p><p><p>E. J. Hundert is Professor of History, the University of British Columbia.</p><p>Hundert is especially good at demonstrating how vital Mandeville's ideas are as a major foundation for more famous Enlightenment thinkers such as Rousseau, Diderot, Voltaire and others. . . . The additions of Nicole and Bayle will be useful in courses on 18th century ethics and morals, and in general surveys of Enlightenment thought. This is probably the best one-volume edition of the main works of Mandeville now available. --Irwin Primer, Rutgers University</p><br><br><p>An excellent edition of a much needed text. E. J. Hundert's addition of clear biographies, a coherent introduction, an appendix, and suggested readings adds to the book's evident value in graduate and undergraduate teaching. Hundert has done an admirable job of contextualizing Mandeville's Fable in the philosophical debates of human morality and sociability that were crucial to the development of liberalism. There can be no better and affordable introduction to the sources for students than Hundert's new edition of this classic. --Fabio Lopez-Lazari, Arizona State University</p></p><h2>On the History of Political Philosophy: Great Political Thinkers from Thucydides to Locke</h2><p>Intended for use in courses on political philosophy or the history of political philosophy, <em>On the History of Political Philosophy</em> provides a critical account of Western political philosophy from classical Greece to modern times.&nbsp; Demonstrating the continued relevance of historical ideas to today's problems, the author traces ongoing discussions about justice, power, and human nature by examining the ideas of key political theorists.</p><p><i>On the History of Political Philosophy: Great Political Thinkers from Thucydides to Locke</i> is a lively and lucid account of the major political theorists and philosophers of the ancient Greek, Roman, medieval, renaissance, and early modern periods.&nbsp;Topics include discussions concerning human nature, different views of justice, the origin of government and law, the rise and development of different forms of government, idealism and realism in international relations, the distinction between just and unjust war, and the sources of public authority and the nature of legitimate sovereignty. The organizing principle of the book is the idea that the great political thinkers were searching for the best political order and a criterion for human conduct in both domestic and international politics. The book presupposes no previous knowledge of political philosophy. It will therefore be a valuable introductory book for students of philosophy, politics, and international relations. As it opens eyes to the perceptions that historical knowledge may convey, it will also be an illuminating and engaging reading for a general reader. &nbsp;<b>W.

Every chapter is packed with dozens of examples of proven word histories, used to illustrate the correct ways to trace the origins of words as well as some of the egregiously bad ways to trace them. He not only tells the known origins of hundreds of words, but also shows how their origins were determined. And along the way, the reader is treated to a wealth of fascinating word facts. Did they once have bells in a belfry? No, the original meaning of belfry was siege tower. Are the words isle and island, raven and ravenous, or pan and pantry related etymologically? No, though they look strikingly similar, these words came to English via different routes. <br><br>Partly a history, partly a how-to, and completely entertaining, <em>Word Origins</em> invites readers behind the scenes to watch an etymologist at work.<br></p><p><br><strong>Anatoly Liberman</strong> is Professor of the Humanities at the University of Minnesota.

Yet for three years he immersed himself among local fighters, amateur and professional. He learned the Sweet science of bruising, participating in all phases of the pugilist's strenuous preparation, from shadow-boxing drills to sparring to fighting in the Golden Gloves tournament. In this experimental ethnography of incandescent intensity, the scholar-turned-boxer fleshes out Pierre Bourdieu's signal concept of <em>habitus</em>, deepening our theoretical grasp of human practice. And he supplies a model for a "carnal sociology" capable of capturing "the taste and ache of action."<br><br><em>Body &amp; Soul</em> marries the analytic rigor of the sociologist with the stylistic grace of the novelist to offer a compelling portrait of a bodily craft and of life and labor in the black American ghetto at century's end.<br></p><p><br><strong>Lo�c Wacquant</strong> is Professor of Sociology at the University of California, Berkeley, and Researcher at the Centre de sociologie europ�enne, Paris.

In <i>Burn Math Class</i>, Jason Wilkes takes the traditional approach to how we learn math--with its unwelcoming textbooks, unexplained rules, and authoritarian assertions-and sets it on fire.<br><br>Focusing on how mathematics is created rather than on mathematical facts, Wilkes teaches the subject in a way that requires no memorization and no prior knowledge beyond addition and multiplication. From these simple foundations, <i>Burn Math Class</i> shows how mathematics can be (re)invented from scratch without preexisting textbooks and courses. We can discover math on our own through experimentation and failure, without appealing to any outside authority. When math is created free from arcane notations and pretentious jargon that hide the simplicity of mathematical concepts, it can be understood organically--and it becomes fun!<br><br>Following this unconventional approach, <i>Burn Math Class</i> leads the reader from the basics of elementary arithmetic to various "advanced" topics, such as time-dilation in special relativity, Taylor series, and calculus in infinite-dimensional spaces. Along the way, Wilkes argues that orthodox mathematics education has been teaching the subject backward: calculus belongs <i>before</i> many of its so-called prerequisites, and those prerequisites cannot be fully understood without calculus.<br><br>Like the smartest, craziest teacher you've ever had, Wilkes guides you on an adventure in mathematical creation that will radically change the way you think about math. Revealing the beauty and simplicity of this timeless subject, <i>Burn Math Class</i> turns everything that seems difficult about mathematics upside down and sideways until you understand just how easy math can be.<br></p><p><b>Jason Wilkes</b> holds an MS in mathematical physics and an MA in psychology.

Teotihuacan is a UNESCO world heritage site, located in highland central Mexico, about twenty-five miles from Mexico City, visited by millions of tourists every year. The book begins with Cuicuilco, a predecessor that arose around 400 BCE, then traces Teotihuacan from its founding in approximately 150 BCE to its collapse around 600 CE. It describes the city&#39;s immense pyramids and other elite structures. It also discusses the dwellings and daily lives of commoners, including men, women, and children, and the craft activities of artisans. George L. Cowgill discusses politics, economics, technology, art, religion, and possible reasons for Teotihuacan&#39;s rise and fall.

The text presents itself as a plea before a tribunal in which the divinely revealed Law of Islam is the sole authority; Averro�s, critical of the anti-philosophical tone of the Islamic establishment, argues that the Law not only permits but also mandates the study of philosophy and syllogistic or logical reasoning, defending earlier Muslim philosophers and dismissing criticisms of them as more harmful to the Islamic community than the philosophers' own views had been. As he details the three fundamental methods the Law uses to aid people of varied capacities and temperaments, Averro�s reveals a carefully formed and remarkably argued conception of the boundaries and uses of faith and reason.</p><p><b>Charles E.

This is when a costume designer uses a pattern made to the wearer's measurements to cut out and sew together a costume. In many cases flat patterning is the more appropriate method for creating a period costume - skirts, pants, and sleeves, for example. However, working in two-dimensions often does not translate correctly onto a three-dimensional dress form or person. Often a designer will need to tweak style lines on a garment once they see it worn, or a costume will need a quick adjustment right before going on stage. In those cases, designers need to know how to correctly drape a costume. Draping is also the best way to construct a period costume right from the start. The construction of garments in earlier centuries often constricted movement, especially in the area of the armhole. The very different size and proportions of contemporary people compared to those in previous centuries makes the use of period patterns difficult. A well-draped garment can give the impression of period accuracy while permitting the wearer greater freedom of movement. Having a mock-up pinned to the form in its early stages is quicker and easier to adapt than drafting a flat pattern, cutting it out of muslin and sewing it. It also provides the opportunity for greater creativity and adaptation as well as a better understanding of what fabric will and won't do.</p> <p>In <i>Draping Period Costumes</i>, Sharon Sobel explains in step-by-step detail the basics of draping and demonstrates the use of those basic skills in the creation of a representative selection of period costumes from a variety of time periods. Chapters are broken into time periods and have two parts: an analysis of how clothing was made and worn during that specific time period, and detailed instruction on draping techniques to construct the costume.

We follow Chicago workers as they make choices about whether to attend ethnic benefit society meetings or to go to the movies, whether to shop in local neighborhood stores or patronize the new A &amp; P. As they made daily decisions like these, they declared their loyalty in ways that would ultimately have political significance. When the depression worsened in the 1930s, workers adopted new ideological perspectives and overcame longstanding divisions among themselves to mount new kinds of collective action. Chicago workers' experiences all converged to make them into New Deal Democrats and CIO unionists. First printed in 1990, Making a New Deal has become an established classic in American history.

This language is used in both secular and religious contexts, but it has deep roots in the Christian theological tradition. Given the increasingly multi-faith context of undergraduate life, many have asked whether this terminology can truly serve as a new vocabulary for higher education. If vocation is to find a foothold in the contemporary context, it will need to be re-examined, re-thought, and re-written; in short, higher education will need to undertake the project of<em> hearing vocation differently</em>. <br><br>In this third volume on vocation from editor David S. Cunningham, the thirteen contributing scholars identify with a wide variety of religious traditions, including Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism, and Sikhism. Some contributors identify with more than one of these; others would claim none of them. The authors met on multiple occasions to read common texts, to discuss agreements and differences, and to respond to one another's writing; some of these responses are included at the end of each chapter. <br><br>Both individually and collectively, these contributors expand the range of vocational reflection and discernment well beyond its traditional Christian origins. The authors observe that all undergraduate students--regardless of their academic field, religious background, or demographic identity-need to make space for reflection, to overcome obstacles to discernment, and to consider the significance of their own narratives, beliefs, and practices. This, in turn, will require college campuses to re-imagine their curricular and co-curricular programming in order to support their students's reflection on issues of meaning, purpose, and identity.<br></p><p><br><strong>David S.

In 1935, aged 22, he developed the mathematical theory upon which all subsequent stored-program digital computers are modeled. At the outbreak of hostilities with Germany in September 1939, he joined the Goverment Codebreaking team at Bletchley Park, Buckinghamshire and played a crucial role in deciphering Engima, the code used by the German armed forces to protect their radio communications. Turing&#39;s work on the version of Enigma used by the German navy was vital to the battle for supremacy in the North Atlantic. He also contributed to the attack on the cyphers known as &#39;Fish&#39; which were used by the German High Command for the encryption of signals during the latter part of the war. His contribution helped to shorten the war in Europe by an estimated two years. After the war, his theoretical work led to the development of Britain&#39;s first computers at the National Physical Laboratory and the Royal Society Computing Machine Laboratory at Manchester University. Turing was also a founding father of modern cognitive science, theorizing that the cortex at birth is an &#39;unorganized machine&#39; which through &#39;training&#39; becomes organized &#39;into a universal machine or something like it&#39; He went on to develop the use of computers to model biological growth, launching the discipline now referred to as Artificial Life. The papers in this book are the key works for understanding Turing&#39;s phenomenal contribution across all these fields. The collection includes Turing&#39;s declassified wartime &#39;Treatise on the Enigma&#39;; letters from Turing to Churchill and to codebreakers; lectures, papers, and broadcasts which opened up the concept of AI and its implications; and the paper which formed the genesis of the investigation of Artifical Life.</p><p><br><strong>B.

Dr. Munoz writes and teaches across the fields of constitutional law, American politics, and political philosophy.The First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution states that &#x201c;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof&#x201d;; and most citizens take this amendment very seriously. This volume looks at 64 Supreme Court cases, from 1879 to 2012, where the separation of church and state comes into question. Each entry opens with the vote and a narrative description of the case, followed by excerpts from primary sources. Seven additional historical documents include Thomas Jefferson&#x2019;s 'A Bill for Establishing Religious Freedom in Virginia,' from 1786, and George Washington&#x2019;s 'Letter to the Hebrew Congregation at Newport,' from 1790. A thorough index and a supplemental table of contents of cases by subject matter offer easy navigation. Recommended for most public and academic libraries. (<i>Booklist</i>)<br><br>Religious liberty has become an increasingly contentious issue in the US in recent years. Most works that address the issue though, take the form of polemic from one perspective or another. In this volume, however, editor Mu�oz, a professor of political science and law at the University of Notre Dame, presents a very exhaustive compendium of large excerpts from the actual landmark Supreme Court cases on religious liberty. The introduction largely concerns the two parts of the First Amendment, the Establishment Clause and the Free Exercise Clause. It discusses important cases bearing on both aspects of the Amendment such as Everson v. Board of Education (1947) where the concept of the 'wall of separation' between church and state originated and Employment Division v. Smith (1990), which tested the limits of the Free Exercise Clause. After this, the book is divided into two sections. In the first there are 64 cases, arranged in chronological order from Reynolds v. United States in 1879 to Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church and School v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 2012. For each case there is a brief introduction which begins with the names of the justices involved, how they voted, and the authorship of the various opinions on the case. There is also a discussion of the background and context of each case here. The second section presents seven vital historical documents on religious liberty by authors such as Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and George Washington. There is also a helpful table that lists every case categorized by subject matter. This volume is an essential reference on the way the view of the Supreme Court on religious liberty has evolved through time. Both lawyers and the layman will find it valuable. (<i>Book News, Inc.</i>)<br><br>Religious liberty in the American constitutional tradition has been shaped by not only the text of the U.S. Constitution, but also by a rich body of historical documents written by influential founders and U.S. Supreme Court case law. Vincent Phillip Mu�oz has expertly compiled and edited the key historical documents and judicial opinions that have defined the prudential and constitutional principles of religious liberty and church-state relationships in the American experience. (Daniel L. Dreisbach, American University, author of Thomas Jefferson and the Wall of Separation between Church and State)<br><br>Professor Mu�oz, one of our most perceptive scholars of religion and government, has assembled an outstanding compendium of the cases and controversies that have created the distinctly American approach to church-state constitutional issues. This volume is an ideal resource for both classroom and reference use. (Donald L. Drakeman, Chairman of the James Madison Program, Princeton University, and author of Church, State, and Original Intent)<br><br>Religious Liberty and the American Supreme Court is a contribution of surpassing significance. For the first time between two covers all the relevant Supreme Court cases are generously excerpted, organized chronologically and edited to show the historical influences upon and the sequential development of the Court&#x2019;s caselaw. The selection is just right, as one would expect from one of the country&#x2019;s leading scholars of the Religion Clauses. Vincent Phillip Mu�oz has wisely decided to limit his own commentary to concise but marvelous introductions to the cases. For these materials speak for themselves, and most professors will welcome relief from the turgid and tendentious commentary so characteristic of other books in the field. Mu�oz&#x2019; deep understanding of the founding and of the judicial corpus nonetheless suffuses the whole work. (Gerard Bradley, University of Notre Dame)<br><br>Religious Liberty and the American Supreme Court is an important addition to the literature on American church and state by a leading scholar. It is an excellent text for undergraduate and law school courses on church and state and a handy resource for anyone interested in how the Supreme Court has struggled to address this controversial issue. (Steven K. Green, Fred H. Paulus Professor of Law, Willamette University and former Legal Director and Special Counsel for Americans United for Separation of Church and State)<br><br>Finally an up-to-date and accessible reader of essential Supreme Court cases on religious liberty and church-state jurisprudence. This text provides judicious excerpts of the major cases, including important concurring and dissenting opinions, making it the ideal resource for undergraduate and law school courses alike. Indeed, I would be hard put to teach my own course on religion and the Constitution without this splendid work. (Allen D. Hertzke, University of Oklahoma)<br><br>I have known Professor Mu�oz for nearly a decade. Although, at times, he and I come out on different sides of the debate regarding religious freedom, I have always greatly admired both his superlative scholarship and his clear and concise writings.

We snuck out to the aircraft just before the sun came up on the eastern horizon. We pushed it to the grassy strip where we would take off. In the distance, we could see some shambling stragglers moving about. It wasn&#x2019;t long before we were airborne. It was a last-minute decision to take Will. He insisted that he go. We were able to establish a communications link with Hotel 23 via the VHF radio on the Cessna. If the girls were to get into any trouble, we would be able to communicate with them. We were looking for a large airport outside a major urban center. Before forcing myself to go to sleep last night I picked out William P. Hobby Airport. It was just south of Houston, outside the center of the city.<br> <br>It was not a long flight. En route we flew over numerous small towns, all with the same speckles of walking dead dominating the streets below. It wasn&#x2019;t forty-five minutes and already we were in sight of Hobby Airport. I thought it safe to lower my altitude, as I would be able to see any living human figures below trying to shoot at me from the open concrete. Approaching the large expanse of paved runway and taxi area I saw yet another symbol of death.<br> <br>A Boeing 737 was on the tarmac with severe fuselage wrinkles indicating a hard crashed landing. It was the only large plane in the airport. There were other, smaller aircraft&#x2014;executive jets and smaller props similar to the Cessna&#x2014;but this was the last of the large passenger jets here at Hobby. We circled around once more to make sure we had the proper assessment before we landed. I could see a fuel truck in the distance near one of the aircraft hangars. The hangar was large compared to the others and was most likely for Boeing aircraft just like the one that is forever disabled on the runway.<br> <br>Our curiosity propelled us and we decided to land the plane near the large aircraft to see if anything of value might be inside. One advantage to this was that it was out in the open and not adjacent to any buildings that would leave us an easy mark for someone or some thing to sneak up on us. William would stay outside near the aircraft to keep watch as we found an entry point. All of the window shades were down on the 737. It wouldn&#x2019;t really matter since the windows were nearly fifteen feet off the ground anyway. The over-wing escape hatches were secure and we were not successful in getting them open as the fuselage ripple stresses had jammed them tight. That left the co-pilot&#x2019;s escape hatch on the starboard side of the cockpit glass.<br> <br>I looked up, ten feet into the air on the right side of the cockpit, and saw how we were going to gain entrance to this aircraft. Using a grapple that Will and I had previously constructed from the rope and some metal left over from last month&#x2019;s tanker explosion, I was able to climb up to the window. First, I supported John&#x2019;s weight on my shoulders as he reached up to open the emergency access latch, releasing the airtight seal to the cockpit.<br> <br>I almost dropped John when he carelessly fumbled the unattached piece of cockpit glass to the floor inside the plane. I cursed when I finally realized what he had done. I grunted under his weight on my shoulders and asked him if he had heard any reactions to our noise from the interior of the aircraft. He replied no, but also said that the smell coming from inside was beyond terrible and that the cockpit access door was closed. Using the pitot tubes jutting from the aluminum skin of the aircraft, John climbed back down off my shoulders and we made a decision.<br> <br>This was enough for me. I wasn&#x2019;t going to risk my ass trying to squeeze through the tight emergency opening only to get it bitten off as I tried to regain my balance on the inside. This aircraft was a tomb and it was going to stay that way. I can only dream of the horrors that are waiting inside. Buckled passengers writhing to be set free from their belts, dead flight attendants carefully walking the aisles, still performing their duties even in the afterlife.<br> <br>We returned to the aircraft to continue formulating our plan for getting the fuel and any other supplies we deemed necessary. The hangar was our goal. I doubted we were going to be able to move the fuel truck to where the aircraft rested so we all climbed back in and I started her up and taxied toward the hangar and the fuel supply. The closer we got, the more we knew the value of &#x201c;ground truth&#x201d; intelligence. We could see movement inside the airport through the aircraft windows. Dead, all of them. I gave them no more thought when I saw the horror spilling out of the open hangar that we were quickly closing on.<br> <br>I stopped the aircraft and left the engine running as I jumped out, rifle in hand. John was out quick and Will followed, spilling out on my side. He started to walk past me when I reached my hand out, the way my mother used to reach out across my chest when our car was about to make a quick stop. He was fixated on the creatures and nearly walked himself into our aircraft&#x2019;s spinning propeller blades.<br> <br>We fell back and began our task of killing them. There were roughly twenty that I could see. I could see shadows of movement dancing underneath the belly of the fuel truck. I screamed out over the engine for the men to kill the ones approaching the propeller first to avoid any aircraft damage. We needed the fuel and we needed to keep the engine running until we were safe from them. It was a Catch-22. I began firing and they followed suit. I killed five before number six refused to go down. Two shots to the head and it still came at me. I gave up on the head and shot its legs out from under it.<br> <br>John and Will were making short work of the others as I picked off the remaining undead behind the fuel truck. We were clear for now. I checked the fuel truck to see if it was in working order. Using the butt of my rifle, I struck the tank. The sound that resonated indicated that there was fuel inside. One thing seemed odd. Why would a small prop aircraft fuel truck be parked in front of the Boeing hangar? I now began to think that I was not the only pilot that had visited this airfield since things went crazy. I wondered if this truck had been used recently/reused, or if I was just overthinking.<br> <br>I climbed up to the driver&#x2019;s window and peered in before I opened it up. Nothing. Keys were inside and it appeared to be in decent condition. I turned over the ignition and it coughed to life on the first attempt. Either someone had been maintaining this vehicle or I was just especially lucky with the battery charge. I flipped the switches for the pumps and got out. Before shutting down the aircraft, I checked our perimeter to make sure we weren&#x2019;t about to be blitzed. As the prop spun down and the engine noise abated, the unnerving clicking sound of jewelry hitting the terminal glass a couple hundred yards away filled my ears and grabbed my attention. The undead almost seemed to protest our taking of the fuel. They could see us from the inside and they were thrashing the glass in protest. Watches, rings and bracelets sounded like loud rain on the tempered glass even from this distance.<br> <br>I unplugged the fuel caps and walked over to the truck. When I opened the control box to flip the switch, a yellow piece of folded legal-sized paper fell out and started to drift downwind. I ran after the paper, caught it with my boot and unfolded it to read:<br> <br>Davis family, Lake Charles airfield, Louisiana. 5/14<br> <br>It was a family . . . survivors. It was brilliant of them to leave this note inside the exterior fuel pump control switchbox. Davis had shown himself to be an intellectual with this single gesture. He didn&#x2019;t overtly spray-paint the runway with his name and location; he left it in a place where another pilot could find it. Aircraft fuel is useless to automobiles, rendering an aircraft fuel truck the same. I took the note and put it in my pocket. Walking up to the aircraft, I could tell John and Will were edgy. I filled the aircraft tanks to the top as I watched them. Will&#x2019;s skin seemed to be getting lighter in color in anticipation of what I was going to say next.<br> <br>Time to check out the hangar.<br> <br>I don&#x2019;t know why they were afraid. The hangar doors were wide open and anything that wanted us could just walk out here and try. After all the gunfire, I was nearly certain that there were no more of those things inside this hangar. I was right.<br> <br>As the three of us broke the threshold of the large rolling hangar doorway, I almost pissed my pants. Something swooped in out of the darkness and nearly hit me in the head. It seems that a family of swallows had a summer nest just above the entryway and the mother didn&#x2019;t like me near her young. I could hear them chirping above. Makes me wonder how many undead eyes she had poked out in the previous weeks. I steered clear of the nest and made my way back to the supplies. The hangar had numerous Plexiglas skylight openings. It was a nice sunny day. The smell of death was in the air, but the smell of rot had followed the undead outside the hangar to their demise at the hands of our small team. It wasn&#x2019;t long before we found the door to the large supply room.<br> <br>Slowly, I opened the door with a long pole commonly used to clean out-of-reach aircraft windows. Nothing but the smell of mothballs rolled out to meet us. This room was clean. I was acclimated to the smell of the undead but I could surely tell when their smell was absent. The supply room could almost have been considered a mini warehouse. The shelves were lined with superfluous aircraft parts and equipment. This was the Boeing supply and maintenance hangar. However, I wasn&#x2019;t looking for jet engine parts, I was looking for survival radios and equipment. It was then that I came upon something that I couldn&#x2019;t leave home without. There were rows of black briefcase-looking devices labeled &#x201c;Inmarsat.&#x201d; We had stumbled upon aviation portable satellite telephones. I had no idea if they were still operational. However, four of them on the right side of the shelf were still sealed in plastic. We took those four and moved them to the door. Continuing our loop around the supply locker we found numerous portable distress radios, inflatable life rafts and other things of that nature. We took the satellite phones and portable VHF maintenance radios and made our exit.<br> <br>We were full on fuel, had four new satellite phones, some portable VHF radios and had also made a startling discovery that a family had headed out to an airstrip in Louisiana weeks ago. It was time to leave. We all loaded up the aircraft and began our journey home. This time I stayed above seven thousand feet until I was almost on top of Hotel 23. I didn&#x2019;t want to take the chance of any stray weapons fire shooting me down. As I approached the compound I called out over the radio to Jan and Tara, telling them, &#x201c;Navy One is three down and locked for a full stop.&#x201d; I mused at the use of the presidential call sign, but no one got it. I bet Davis would get it. We landed and hid the aircraft once again. I entered the complex thinking of the Davis family and wondered if they ever made it to that airfield.</p><h2>Ten Prayers That Changed the World: Extraordinary Stories of Faith That Shaped the Course of History</h2><p>From time immemorial, prayer has provided comfort in our darkest hours, stirred us to action beyond what we thought possible, and shown us the way through seemingly insurmountable challenges.

This results in a cluttered living space and often causes distress and impairs the person from being able to fully function in their home. It&#39;s a common condition that affects 2-5% of the population and has far-reaching consequences for sufferers, family, friends and the wider community, together with potential health and safety implications, with increased risk of injury or vermin. There has been increasing interest in the media which has raised public awareness of this problem, but there has been very little literature aimed at helping hoarders until now. There is no one reason why individuals hoard. For some, the hoarding behaviours are a way of coping with an emotional trauma. For others, there may be a strong attachment to certain objects, or a belief that certain materials have value - such as books, magazines and newspapers. Hoarding behaviour can also be a learnt behaviour from growing up in a cluttered environment. Sometimes unusual items or objects are hoarded including faeces and urine. Hoarding is a common condition but little is known about it. Almost everyone has some hoarding traits but these may not manifest themselves to the extent that it causes disruption to a person&#39;s life and space. The true prevalence of hoarding is not clear however it appears to be a growing problem. With the increased attention that hoarding is getting more people are beginning to recognize that they may have a problem. This book fills an important gap for a dedicated book on hoarding disorder, and uses CBT tools to help people recover, and reclaim their space and their life.</p><p>Satwant Singh is a Nurse Consultant, Cognitive Behavioural Therapist and Mental Health and Clinical Lead.

By examining these ideas, and the role they have played both in and outside of the therapeutic setting, Hillman mounts a compelling argument that, rather than locking them away in some inner asylum or subjecting them to daily self-treatment, man's "peculiarities" can become an integral part of a rich and fulfilling daily life.<br><br>Originally published by Northwestern University Press in 1972, this work had a profound impact on a nation emerging self-aware from the 1960s, as well as on the era's burgeoning feminist movement.

The authors challenge the notion that biblical monotheism is legitimately represented by a Trinitarian view of God and demonstrate that within the bounds of the canon of Scripture Jesus is confessed as Messiah, Son of God, but not God Himself. Later Christological developments beginning in the second century misrepresented the biblical doctrine of God and Christ by altering the terms of the biblical presentation of the Father and Son. This fateful development laid the foundation of a revised, unscriptural creed that needs to be challenged. This book is likely to be a definitive presentation of a Christology rooted, as it originally was, in the Hebrew Bible. The authors present a sharply-argued appeal for an understanding of God and Jesus in the context of the original Christian documents.

Hunting</b> is a retired pastor and college business manager.From the Foreword: I could not read Christianity's Self-Inflicted Wound without becoming excited again about the primitive Christian (and Jewish) doctrine that "God is One." If there are any Nicene encrustations in one's mind and life, this book should sweep them all away. <p>It is a pleasing experience to read Anthony Buzzard's and Charles Hunting's clear explanations of key passages of Scripture usually seen before through a Trinitarian prism. At the same time it is a delight to read concise statements which are certain to etch themselves upon the reader's mind. An example is the explanation of Thomas's great confession in John 20:28. Thomas recognized in the risen Jesus the one appointed to be "God" of the coming age, replacing Satan, the "God" of the present age. However, Thomas' words "Lord" and "God" are simply Messianic titles in the Old Testament and medieval Jewish sense. The previously doubting Apostle did not suddenly adopt the Nicene or the Athanasian Creed and see his Lord as "very God of very God." The Gospel of John must not be forced to conform to much later speculation by Greek theologians. </p><p>No apparent Trinitarian or preexistence passage is left unchallenged. (This includes the enigmatic saying of Jesus in John 8:58 which must be balanced by the many other Christological statements in John and by the rest of Scripture.) It is a major point and basis of the book that the assertion of Christ's preexistence as God the Son placed a strain on the truth of his humanity, in theological thinking, which it was unable to bear. </p><p>In this connection Buzzard and Hunting advance a most interesting thesis: John's epistles are his answer to those Gnostic heretics who misused his Gospel. John labels their treatment of his Gospel as very "antichrist." </p><p>But the authors of Christianity's Self-Inflicted Wound are not content to settle for explanations of the critical texts of Scripture. They are usually followed by the confirmatory words of prominent theologians in Europe and North America. Their familiarity with the entire field of theological opinion, especially on the subject of the Trinity, is obvious and impressive. </p><p>There is a pleasing element of humor in this book which elevates it above the genre of textbook and tome. Professor Buzzard and Charles Hunting point out that one of the great marvels of Christian history has been the ability of post-biblical theologians to convince Christian people that three Persons are really One God. Paul preached the whole counsel of God (Acts 20:28). Why did he not explain the Trinity? </p><p>In discussing Jesus' use of the word "only" in John 17:3 ("the only true God") the authors write that we would be suspicious of anyone who claimed he had "only one wife" if his household consisted of three separate women, all of whom he claimed were his one wife! </p><p>Paul explained to the Corinthians "that there is no God but One," defining that One God as the Father only. He went on to say that "not all have this knowledge." The authors add: "We are tempted to think that not much has changed since the first century." </p><p>Finally, in this regard, the doctrine of the Trinity is an adult theological myth. Christianity condemns the world for imposing the unproved theory of evolution on mankind. But orthodoxy imposes something equally problematic: a multiple-person God. </p><p>It is a familiar criticism of the Protestant Reformation that it only went back to the Council of Nicea. There it encountered a roadblock, in this instance a barricade built of politics, philosophy, bigotry, envy, and intrigue. The authors of this book are not deterred by any such roadblock - Nicea, Chalcedon or otherwise. </p><p>Christianity's Self-Inflicted Wound does not attempt to hurdle the early church councils, nor does it detour around them. It meets them head on, drives through them, and arrives at the more authoritative "decrees" of Jesus and the Apostles. If Jesus evidently was not a Trinitarian, why should his followers be? </p><p>Readers will be intrigued by the title of this book. It is most appropriate for the authors' thesis. As far as the pristine Jewish Christianity of Jesus and the Apostles is concerned, the wound has been nearly fatal. The patient's life has been spared by the scriptural principle that God always has His remnant. </p><p>To express it another way (the illustration is mine, not the authors'), the dogma of the Trinity is that potion of hemlock which Gnostically-inclined theologians deliberately chose to drink, mixing the pure stream of Hebrew doctrine with the poison of Greek philosophy. Then they forced the mixture on their disciples. The penalty for refusal would be eternal damnation. </p><p>If there is a key text to the book, it is John 17:3, "And this is life eternal, that they might know You, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom You have sent." In this connection the authors make much of the fact that Jesus was the Son of God from conception, not from eternity (Luke 1:35). He came into the world en sarki, a human being, not into a human body (cp. 1 John 4:2; 2 John 7). </p><p>Trinitarianism has long had a field day in charging that non-Trinitarian believers are not really Christians. The Athanasian Creed is renowned for its damnatory clauses. The authors counter this charge by pointing out that "eternal life" (the life of the coming Kingdom) is linked with knowledge of the truth about God and Jesus (John 17:3; 1 Tim. 2:4, 5). It is the Trinitarians who should be on the defensive, not the biblical unitarians. The latter group has had its heroic exponents and the authors give us much of their little-known history. </p><p>This book is a telling indictment of the central dogma of historic or mainstream Christianity - that version of the faith which, unknown to many, stems from the councils and the creeds. Christianity still prostrates itself before the low wrought-gold throne of Constantine. Its dogma has produced tragic and bloody episodes in history. Something is askew. - Sidney Hatch, B.A., M.Div., Th.M.</p></p><h2>Comanche Woman (Sisters of the Lone Star)</h2><p><b>In this captivating prequel to the <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers <i>The Cowboy </i>and<i> The Texan, </i>Joan Johnston tells the story of a woman kidnapped by Comanches&#x2014;and the proud warrior who vows to make her love him.</b><br> &nbsp;<br> Living as a Comanche, the son of a white father and his Indian bride, Long Quiet secretly dreams of making Bayleigh Stewart, daughter of the richest cotton planter in Texas, his wife.

That's what Gene Baur had been told -- but when he first visited a stockyard he realized that this rosy depiction couldn't be more inaccurate. <br> <br> Amid the stench, noise, and filth, his attention was drawn in particular to one sheep who had been cast aside for dead. But as Baur walked by, the sheep raised her head and looked right at him. She was still alive, and the one thing Baur knew for sure that day was that he had to get her to safety. Hilda, as she was later named, was nursed back to health and soon became the first resident of Farm Sanctuary -- an organization dedicated to the rescue, care, and protection of farm animals. <br> <br> The truth is that farm production does not depend on the family farmer with a small herd of animals but instead resembles a large, assembly-line factory. Animals raised for human consumption are confined for the entirety of their lives and often live without companionship, fresh air, or even adequate food and water.Viewed as production units rather than living beings with feelings, ten billion farm animals are exploited specifically for food in the United States every year. <br> <br> In <i>Farm Sanctuary</i>, Baur provides a thoughtprovoking investigation of the ethical questions involved in the production of beef, poultry, pork, milk,and eggs -- and what each of us can do to stop the mistreatment of farm animals and promote compassion. He details the triumphs and the disappointments of more than twenty years on the front lines of the animal protection movement. And he introduces sanctuary. us to some of the special creatures who live at Farm Sanctuary -- from Maya the cow to Marmalade the chicken -- all of whom escaped horrible circumstances to live happier, more peaceful lives. <i>Farm Sanctuary</i> shows how all of us have an opportunity and a responsibility to consume a kinder plate, making a better life for ourselves and animals as well. You will certainly never think of a hamburger or chicken breast the same way after reading this book.</p><p><b>Gene Baur</b> is the president and cofounder of the nation's leading farm animal protection organization, Farm Sanctuary, which advocates the fair treatment of farm animals, a return to the roots of agriculture, and the end of animals' suffering for our consumption. Since 1986 his organization has not only helped to enact groundbreaking laws and policies to help prevent sick and diseased animals from ending up on our menus but has also rescued sick, abandoned, and abused animals from farms, stockyards, and slaughterhouses across the country. Baur and his colleagues provide, on farms in New York and California, a safe home and a healthful life for animals who are in desperate need of rescue.

It had a bed on top, another pullout bed on the bottom, a small refrigerator (which never worked very well), a stove powered by a propane tank, and a tiny sink. At the end of the year, Lorri came out to Los Angeles, and in January 1986, the two of us drove across the country to Washington, D.C., to work in the animal advocacy movement.</p><p>We were young, fired up, and ready to take on the world. We wanted to make the cruelties of factory farming and its dangers to human health and the environment better known to the public. We also got involved in other aspects of the animal rights movement. That winter, four of us living in D.C. decided to attend an anti-fur demonstration at Macy's, which then sold and continues to sell fur. The protest was organized by a very active group in New York City, Trans-Species Unlimited, which held a number of highly visible and successful animal rights protests in the mid-to late 1980s.</p><p>On the four-hour drive up to New York, we began batting around ideas for other ways of documenting and letting the public know about what life was like for the billions of animals caught up in the industrialized farm system in the United States. We agreed we could reach many more people if we got on the road than we could from our office in Washington, D.C. By the end of the trip, Lorri and I had settled on a plan to start Farm Sanctuary. No one had a clear idea of what it was going to be, except that somehow it would combat factory farming and do so through some form of education and outreach. Back then, we didn't know what we'd be doing in the next five hours, never mind the next five years. We hit on a word that resonated with all of us -- <i>sanctuary</i> -- though we really had no clear idea that we would create an actual farm that would rescue farmed animals, take care of them, and encourage people to visit. We simply latched on to the idea of an oasis and decided to see where it led.</p><p>One of our fellow activists was so enthusiastic about the idea that he told us we could live and work in a row house he owned at 224 Stroud Street in the Browntown area of Wilmington, Delaware. Rent-free and available sounded good to us, so a couple of weeks later we left D.C. and moved in to begin Farm Sanctuary -- whatever that meant. The house was not luxurious. In fact, it was a mess (read: close to uninhabitable). The previous tenant had died suddenly and unexpectedly, and the house had quickly fallen into disrepair. The water pipes leaked into the kitchen ceiling, which eventually collapsed, and that was just the start of a long list of needed repairs. For the next few months we had our work cut out for us.</p><p>In April 1986, Farm Sanctuary was incorporated and we began producing advocacy literature. We knew, generally speaking, the conditions for animals on factory farms and in slaughterhouses, but little about the specifics and had never visited a factory farm. We felt that in order to be credible advocates we should have firsthand knowledge. Despite the publication in 1980 of <i>Animal Factories</i>, Jim Mason and Peter Singer's seminal work, relatively little documentation was publicly available on American industrialized animal agriculture.</p><p>Life Inside the Stockyards</p><p>It was the historian and activist Bernard Unti, then working at the American Anti-Vivisection Society, who first suggested we investigate the conditions at the stockyard in nearby Lancaster, Pennsylvania. I would soon confront the sights, smells, and otherworldly sounds of the modern livestock trade. Lancaster Stockyards was one of the oldest in the United States, incorporated in 1895. By 1908, the stockyard was dealing with 170,000 cattle a year and still growing. At its peak in the 1940s, 450,000 animals a year were brought to market there. It was at Lancaster that livestock was sold and then slaughtered for meat for the growing populations of cities such as Baltimore and Philadelphia. Lancaster was known as a terminal market, similar to the Union Stock Yards in Chicago and the South St. Paul Stockyards in Minnesota -- and as the name suggests, a terminal market is the last stop for an animal before he or she is killed.</p><p>When we first visited in the mid-1980s, Lancaster was still handling over 300,000 animals a year from as far away as Montana and Texas, but it was no longer the economic powerhouse it once had been. Increasingly, it was serving niche markets, such as sheep and goat meat for ethnic communities on the East Coast, as well as marketing animals from Amish and Mennonite farms in the region. Both the Amish and Mennonites, who prided themselves on their resistance to the mores of American industrial society, were accommodating themselves to the modern world. Some were driving motorized vehicles rather than horse-drawn buggies, including the "black bumper Mennonites," who'd painted their cars' chrome bumpers black so they wouldn't appear too ostentatious. Because the law required that milk be refrigerated, many of the farmers had begun using electricity. And since banks tended to provide loans only if you adopted the latest technology and intensified operations, Amish and Mennonite farmers were beginning to practice aspects of factory farming, such as confining their hens in small "battery" cages and male calves in tiny crates to produce veal.</p><p>Lancaster Stockyards was huge, stretching across twenty-two acres to the north of the town. It was shaped like a grid and consisted of outdoor wooden pens with large gates, "long-legged barns" for the adult cattle, and "short-legged barns" for calves, pigs, sheep, and goats. These areas were bisected with alleyways, loading docks, and auction rings, where animals were paraded and then sold to the highest bidder. Trucks would travel from farms to the stockyard and back up to the loading dock, which was usually about four or so feet off the ground, and the animals would be herded down a ramp and through the alleyways into the holding pens.</p><p>Much of the stockyard was paved with cobblestones, which a stockyard worker once told me had been brought to America as ballast in empty ships that sailed from Europe. These ships would then return heavy with food and other products from the New World. I spent countless hours walking on those cobblestones and through the alleyways that connected the pens with the auction rings.</p><p>Lancaster was the first stockyard I ever visited, and over the spring and summer of 1986, I went there often. It was completely different from anything I'd experienced before. The smells of manure and death were everywhere. On sale days the market bustled -- sheep and goats bleated, cows mooed, truck engines rumbled as they backed up to the loading dock, and ramps clanked as they were put into place. You could hear banging as the animals shifted their weight inside the trucks and as their hoofs struck the hard metal floors. And always there was the squealing of pigs. The very buildings of Lancaster Stockyards seemed to groan. Because the wooden corrals were covered in sheet metal, which expanded and contracted in the heat and cold, the roofs creaked constantly. In summer the stockyard was wretchedly humid; in winter everything, including the water in the troughs for the animals, froze.</p><p>I quickly found there was little room for sentimentality inside the stockyard. Men yelled at the animals as they herded them through the alleyways, hitting them with whips and canes and shocking them with electric prods to get them to move as quickly as possible to their pens or the auction ring. The animals looked terrified and often scrambled over each other to avoid being hit. During our earliest visits we spent most of our time taking photographs and then, later, shooting video footage. We also kept a lookout for stockyard workers and tried to avoid trouble, but because the stockyard was a public market, it was hard for its management to deny us the right to be there.</p><p>Almost as soon as we began to visit Lancaster Stockyards, we would come across animals lying dead or injured in the alleyways or the holding pens. Either they had been hurt in the stockyard during handling or unloading, or they had arrived injured or sick and were unable to stand. Those who were dead on arrival or who'd died soon after were picked up and moved to what was unsentimentally called the dead pile. At Lancaster, the dead pile was a concrete slab with cinder-block walls on three sides located at the back of one of the buildings near the railroad tracks. (Trains had been the main method of transporting animals to the stockyard until the 1960s, when trucks became the sole form of delivery.)</p><p>The carcasses on the dead pile would stay there until the renderer came around. Depending on the level of the animals' decay, the renderer would skin the bodies of their hides for leather, boil them and siphon off the fat for soap, or use the flesh to feed other animals. The rest would be turned into fertilizer. Disposing of dead or dying animals at the dead pile was a service the stockyard provided to farmers, and it saved the renderer from making trips to individual farms to gather up the bodies.</p><p>One hot and humid Sunday in August 1986, as we walked by the dead pile, we saw carcasses of a cow, a couple of pigs, and some sheep decaying in the heat -- nothing unusual. The body of a calf had decomposed enough for us to see his rib cage. The stench was overpowering. A swarm of thick, fat maggots, inches deep, was burrowing into the calf's flesh, buzzing as they did so. To the side of the pile near one of the walls, we saw a sheep lying on her side. As we approached, something remarkable happened: the sheep lifted up her head and looked at us.</p><p>I was stunned. Lorri and I looked at each other in horror. Without exchanging a word we both knew that we couldn't let the animal stay where she was. Our first, overpowering thought was that somehow we had to get this sheep out of there.</p><p>Technically, though, we did not own the sheep and t...</p></p><h2>Common Edible &amp; Poisonous Mushrooms of the Northeast</h2><p><li>Handy in-the-field identification guide</li><li>Features the "Foolproof Five"</li><li>Includes a useful identification flowchart<p>The northeastern United States is home to an enormous variety of mushrooms--some delicious, some deadly.

The sector chosen was Kharkov, where the Soviet Southwestern Front had seized bridgeheads over the Donets River and Heeresgruppe S�d appeared vulnerable. Under Stalin's trusted military advisor, Marshal Semyon Timoshenko, the Stavka's remaining reserves were assembled and prepared to conduct a breakthrough attack intended to encircle the German Sixth Army near Kharkov.<br>However, Stalin was unaware that the Germans were planning their own riposte at Kharkov, known as Operation Fredericus. When Timoshenko began his offensive in May 1942, he did not realize the limitations of his own forces or the agility of the Germans to recover from setbacks, all of which contributed to one of the Red Army greatest defeats of World War II. The German victory at Kharkov also contributed to the Wehrmacht's ability to push to the Volga River, once the Red Army was seriously weakened along the Donets. This volume will pay particular attention to intelligence and logistics issues, as well as how this campaign served as a prelude to the battle of Stalingrad. It will also focus on the nascent development of the Red Army's tank corps and 'deep battle' tactics, as well as the revival of the German Panzertruppen after Barbarossa.</p></p><p>Robert Forczyk has a PhD in International Relations and National Security from the University of Maryland and a strong background in European and Asian military history.

This year, since half the clan is scattered across the American West, they&#x2019;ve decided to split the difference and meet up in Tucson. Matt and Luke will be there, for sure, and maybe Ace and Chance, too. That leaves Sally, Preacher, and Smoke Jensen, who&#x2019;ve reserved three seats on a westbound stage to make sure they don&#x2019;t miss out on the festivities. What could possibly go wrong?<br> &nbsp;<br> The first to strike is a sandstorm as blinding and deadly as any northern blizzard. Then comes an Apache ambush, forcing the passengers and drivers to seek shelter in a cave. Even if Smoke and Preacher manage to shoot their way out of this, they have another big surprise waiting&#x2014;a ruthless gang of outlaws after the cargo of cash on the stage, happy to slaughter anyone who tries to stop them.

Inspired by the wildcat victory in West Virginia, teachers in Oklahoma, Arizona, and across the country walked off their jobs and shut down their schools to demand better pay for educators, more funding for students, and an end to years of austerity.<br><br> Confounding all expectations, these working-class rebellions erupted in regions with Republican electorates, weak unions, and bans on public sector strikes. By mobilizing to take their destinies into their own hands, red state school workers posed a clear alternative to politics as usual. And with similar actions now gaining steam in Los Angeles, Oakland, Denver, and Virginia, there is no sign that this upsurge will be short-lived.<br><br> <i>Red State Revolt</i> is a compelling analysis of the emergence and development of this historic strike wave, with an eye to extracting its main strategic lessons for educators, labor organizer, and radicals across the country. A former high school teacher and longtime activist, Eric Blanc embedded himself into the rank-and-file leaderships of the walkouts, where he was given access to internal organizing meetings and secret Facebook groups inaccessible to most journalists. The result is one of the richest portraits of the labor movement to date, a story populated with the voices of school workers who are winning the fight for the soul of public education&#x2014;and redrawing the political map of the country at large.</p><p>A former high school teacher, <b>Eric Blanc</b> has covered the strike wave for <i>Jacobin</i>, <i>The Nation</i>, and <i>The Guardian</i>.&#x201c;Eric Blanc&#x2019;s compelling new book, <i>Red State Revolt</i>, is a thoroughly researched and eloquently written story of one of the most powerful social movements of our time. His incisive reporting shows how teachers, through labor organizing and strategic strikes, are protecting and strengthening public education, the great equalizing force of any democratic society.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;Amy Goodman, Host &amp; Executive Producer, <i>Democracy Now!</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;Before 2018, strikes had become so rare in this country that hardly anyone knew what they were. Then, seemingly out of nowhere, they began. Not in left-wing cities but in the reddest of red states. Not of white men in factories but of teachers, many of them women, many of them of color. Eric Blanc spent months with the strikers, talking to them on picket lines, listening to them in meetings, sharing with them on Facebook threads, and more. Like Orwell in Barcelona, he&#x2019;s given us a first-hand report from the front lines, making sense of the most improbable political story of an improbable decade. This is exhilarating reading about a movement that will be shaping politics for decades to come.&#x201d;<br> <b>&#x2014;Corey Robin, author of <i>The Reactionary Mind: Conservatism from Edmund Burke to Donald Trump</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;Eric Blanc has written the best on-the-ground description and explanation of the red state teachers&#x2019; revolt. He was there and he understands that what happened is historic. The brave teachers who walked out in West Virginia, Oklahoma, Arizona, and other red states started a powerful trend. They give hope that the reactionary politics of the past forty years may be reversed by working people who realize that &#x2018;enough is enough.&#x2019; Blanc&#x2019;s enthralling description of their struggles is a chronicle that should be widely read.&#x201d;<br> <b>&#x2014;Diane Ravitch, author of <i>The Death and Life of the Great American School System</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;Read this book to understand the many important lessons educators so powerfully taught about what it will take to rebuild a working-class movement, defeat Trumpism, and take on the billionaires.&#x201d;<br> <b>&#x2014;Jane McAlevey, author of <i>No Shortcuts: Organizing for Power in the New Gilded Age</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;The last places in today&#x2019;s America you would expect mass strikes would be the ultra-red states of West Virginia, Oklahoma, and Arizona&#x2014;until tens of thousands of education workers there organized themselves and shut down the schools. <i>Red State Revolt</i> gives a unique inside view of how these actions were organized and how they forced state governments and rightwing politicians not only to raise teachers pay but to elevate the role of public education. If you want to understand the power of workers and the strike, even in a time when labor seems down if not out, read <i>Red State Revolt</i>.&#x201d;<br> <b>&#x2014;Jeremy Brecher, author of <i>Strike!</i></b></p><h2>A Criminal and An Irishman: The Inside Story of the Boston Mob - IRA Connection</h2><p>Former rival and associate of James "Whitey" Bulger tells all. After returning&nbsp;from&nbsp;Vietnam where he&nbsp;served as a combat Marine, Pat Nee fought a gang war against Whitey Bulger.&nbsp;When members of Nee's Mullen gang killed the leader of Bulger's Killeen faction, Nee arranged for the dispute to be mediated by&nbsp;Howie Winter&nbsp;and&nbsp;Patriarca crime family&nbsp;captain&nbsp;Joseph Russo. The two gangs joined forces, with Winter as overall boss.&nbsp;When Winter was convicted of fixing horse races in 1979, Bulger became leader, and&nbsp;Nee responded by concentrating his energy on raising money and smuggling guns to the&nbsp;Provisional IRA.&nbsp;Disgusted by Bulger's brutality, and increasingly focused on the Irish cause, Nee distanced himself from his former ally. Ultimately it was revealed that, for years, Bulger had&nbsp;served as&nbsp;an FBI informant.&nbsp;<br><i><br>A Criminal and an Irishman </i>is the story of Pat Nee&#x2019;s life as an Irish immigrant and Southie son, a Marine, a convicted IRA gun smuggler, and a former violent rival and then associate of James "Whitey" Bulger. His narrative transports the reader into the criminal underworld, inside planning and preparation for an armored car heist, inside gang wars and revenge killings. Nee details his evolution from tough street kid to armed robber to dangerous potential killer, and discloses for the first time how he used his underworld connections and know-how as a secret, Boston-based operative for the Irish Republican Army. For years Pat smuggled weapons and money from the United States to Ireland &#x2013; in the bottoms of coffins, behind false panels of vans &#x2013; leading up to a transatlantic shipment of seven and a half tons of munitions aboard the fishing trawler Valhalla. No other Southie underworld figure can match Pat&#x2019;s reputation for resolve and authenticity.</p><p><p>At fourteen <b>Patrick Nee</b> became associated with the gang that would later battle Whitey Bulger for rights to Southie&#x2019;s criminal activities. A Marine veteran of Vietnam, Pat helped the Irish Republican Army smuggle money, guns, and munitions out of the United States. He served nearly two years in prison for the Valhalla smuggling operation, received early parole, then promptly attempted to rob an armored car in order to raise funds for the IRA. He served nine years for this later conviction, and today he works as a day laborer and spends time with his two daughters and grandchildren. He lives in South Boston.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Richard Farrell</b> won the du Pont&#x2014;Columbia Award for Excellence in Broadcast Journalism for his film High on Crack Street.

Everything detailed in this book I have either done, seen done, or heard about from the person who did it. Most reporters and authors who write Southie gangster books use CIs - confidential informers - as sources. However, seldom is the majority of information compiled by these sources correct information. Confidential informers are self-serving criminals who lie. This book is different from other books on the Boston Irish mob or any other &#39;Whitey/Southie&#39; crime book. If my recollections don&#39;t match those in some other book by some other criminal, I don&#39;t care. My memory is not perfect. This is my life as I remember it.

Cox comes this insightful new history of the critical Guadalcanal and Solomons campaign at the height of World War II. His previous book, <i>Morning Star, Rising Sun</i>, had found the US Navy at its absolute nadir and the fate of the <i>Enterprise, </i>the last operational US aircraft carrier at this point in the war, unknown. This new volume continues the history of this critical campaign, combining detailed research with a novelist's flair for the dramatic to reveal exactly how, despite missteps and misfortunes, the tide of war finally began to turn. There were hard-fought and costly American victories in the first and second naval battles of Guadalcanal in November 1942, as well as the battle of Bismarck Sea in March 1943. By this point Japanese land forces had also been forced to withdraw from Guadalcanal itself marking the successful completion of the first Allied offensive campaign against Japan. From this point on, although the war was still a long way from being won, the American star was unquestionably on the ascendant, slowly, but surely, casting a long shadow over the Imperial Sun. </p><p>Jeffrey Cox's analysis and attention to detail of even the smallest events are second to none. But what truly sets this book apart is how he combines this microscopic attention to detail, often unearthing new facts along the way, with an engaging style that transports the reader to the heart of the story, bringing the events on the deep blue of the Pacific vividly to life.</p></p><p><b>Jeffrey R.

Through this collection and through his own words and analysis of his major speeches and writings, Jensen and Hammerback reveal the rhetorical qualities and underlying rhetorical dynamics of a master communicator and also offer a rich source of the history of the farm workers' movement Ch�vez led from the early 1960s to his death in 1993.<br><br>Each chapter features a clear introductory section that helps the reader focus on the highlights that won Ch�vez a reputation as an effective communicator. The editors explain the sources of Ch�vez's motivation to campaign for farm workers, his selection of characteristic and signature rhetorical elements, and the success of specific campaigns and his overall career.<br><br><i>The Words of C�sar </i><i>Ch�vez</i> offers an important new resource for scholars of public discourse, Chicano studies, and C�sar Ch�vez himself. It complements the editors' earlier study, <i>The Rhetorical Career of C�sar </i><i>Ch�vez</i><i>,</i> by providing the primary materials for that rhetorical profile of Ch�vez. Through his own words, Jensen and Hammerback present Ch�vez doing what he did best: teaching and influencing audiences who would enact his agenda to create a new and better world.</p><p>Richard J.

Parre�as tells the interweaving stories of wildlife workers and the centers' endangered animals while demonstrating the inseparability of risk and futurity from orangutan care. Drawing on anthropology, primatology, Southeast Asian history, gender studies, queer theory, and science and technology studies, Parre�as suggests that examining workers&#x2019; care for these semi-wild apes can serve as a basis for cultivating mutual but unequal vulnerability in an era of annihilation. Only by considering rehabilitation from perspectives thus far ignored, Parre�as contends, could conservation biology turn away from ultimately violent investments in population growth and embrace a feminist sense of welfare, even if it means experiencing loss and pain.</p><p>Juno Salazar Parre�as is Assistant Professor of Women&#x2019;s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies at The Ohio State University and editor of <i>Gender: Animals</i>."This is seriously thought-provoking and challenging material, and it may be essential to understand it if we want to save orangutans from ourselves." -- John R. Platt, <i>The Revelator</i> Published On: 2018-08-01<br><br>"Impactful. . . .&nbsp; Juno S. Parre�as details diverse assumptions and expectations participants bring to this complex network, thereby generating a unique and timely addition to the conservation literature.&nbsp;Highly recommended. Advanced undergraduates through faculty and professionals." -- L. K. Sheeran, <i>Choice</i> Published On: 2019-05-01<br><br>"<i>Decolonizing Extinction</i> is essential reading for anyone with the ambition to do multispecies ethnography well. It&#x2019;s also a beautiful and moving book that struggles with the ethical weight of ethnography as a mode of knowledge production." -- Gabriel N. Rosenberg, <i>Radical History Review</i> Published On: 2019-07-24<br><br>"[This book] excels in these tricky in-between places: in meetings between species, between temporalities, between bodies, between genders, between sexes, and across divergent positions within colonial histories and presents. Parre�as tracks meetings across difference with the best kind of ethnographic sensitivity." -- Rosemary Collard, <i>Society &amp; Space</i> Published On: 2019-09-01<br><br>"<i>Decolonizing Extinction</i> offers a compelling example of why feminism is well suited and positioned to take on issues related to animals, as well as how gender relations of power are necessarily embedded in human-animal relations, and in turn broader process of colonization and arrested autonomy." -- Alice Hovorka, <i>Society &amp; Space</i> Published On: 2019-09-01<br><br>"The book brilliantly weaves discussions about broader socio-political transformations and norms alongside very careful and detailed accounts of the everyday practices and interactions between orangutans and people." -- Krithika Srinivasan, <i>Society &amp; Space</i> Published On: 2019-09-01<br><br>"A powerful, thought-provoking, and touching account of the quotidian nature of mass extinction." -- Becky Mansfield, <i>Society &amp; Space</i> Published On: 2019-09-01<br><br>"Parre�as&#x2019;s <i>Decolonizing Extinction</i> is a beautifully written book, in which she uses a case study of orangutan rehabilitation on Borneo to weave together many complex analytic threads: gender, race, and labor; care, violence, and freedom; liberalism and neoliberalism; the geological past, the colonial present, and the prospect of a different future." -- Rebecca Lave, <i>Society &amp; Space</i> Published On: 2019-09-01</p><h2>Science Fiction: A Literary History</h2><p>Science fiction (SF) has existed as a popular genre for around 150 years. This book offers a survey of the genre from 19th-century pioneers to contemporary authors, introducing the plural versions of early SF across the world, before examining the emergence of the &#34;scientific romance&#34; in the 1880s and 1890s. The &#34;Golden Age&#34; of writers&#39; expansive SF pulp was concentrated in the 1930s, consolidated by best-selling writers like Isaac Asimov and Robert Heinlein. The contributors to this volume also track the increasingly diverse forms SF took from the 1950s onwards. Leading international scholars, writing in an accessible style, consider SF as a world literature, referencing works from diverse traditions in Latin America, Europe, Russia and the Far East. This book combines discussion of central figures of the tradition with a new global reach.</p><p><b>Roger Luckhurst</b> is a professor of modern literature.

Author/historian Grayson uncovered previously unknown original source materials to shed new light on one of history&#x2019;s greatest sailors while answering questions that have been asked ever since the publication of Sailing Alone.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>In June 1898, three years and two months after departing Boston in his aged oyster sloop Spray, Captain Joshua Slocum made land fall in New England and became the first person ever to sail alone around the world. The voyage capped a lifetime of adventure for the indomitable Slocum, who had advanced from seaman to captain during the challenging final years of commercial sail, surviving hurricanes, mutinies, shipwreck, and the death at sea of his beloved first wife, Virginia. <em>Sailing Alone Around the World</em>, Slocum&#x2019;s book about his circumnavigation, is a seafaring classic, unmatched for adventure and literary verve, and has never been out of print since its publication in 1900. &nbsp;</p><p>Yet despite several biographies over the decades, Slocum the man has remained unknowable to his legions of admirers, the facts of his life and career as elusive as a ship on a fogbound sea.</p><p>Here is the real story of Slocum&#x2019;s Nova Scotia childhood, his seafaring career, and how he became an American citizen. Grayson gives ample evidence of Slocum&#x2019;s uncanny genius as a navigator while also noting the occasional role that good luck played in his voyages, including his odyssey from Brazil to the United States in the self-designed and built 35-foot Liberdade. And Grayson brings a sailor&#x2019;s perspective to Slocum&#x2019;s solo circumnavigation and mysterious disappearance at sea.&nbsp;</p><p>A fascinating appendix compares <em>Sailing Alone Around the World</em> with Thoreau&#x2019;s <em>Walden</em> and shows that Slocum&#x2019;s simple lifestyle and self-sufficiency prefigured today&#x2019;s emphases on the environment and living responsibly. &nbsp;Previously unpublished photographs bring Slocum&#x2019;s world to life, and detailed maps trace the adventures of a sailor who knew the world like the back of his hand. This biography reads like an adventure narrative and will serve as the standard work on Joshua Slocum for years to come.</p> B&amp;W photographs and maps</p><p>STAN GRAYSON (Marblehead, MA) has written extensively about American yachting and small-craft history. His work has appeared in Nautical Quarterly, WoodenBoat, and other publications, and his books include <em>Cape Cod Catboats; The Wianno Senior Story: A Century on Nantucket Sound</em>; and, most recently, <em>A Man for All Oceans: Captain Joshua Slocum and the First Solo Voyage Around the World.</em>&#x201c; <p>&#x201c;What a tale it is,&#x201d; Stan Grayson writes in his latest book, A Man for All Oceans. This is a biography of Captain Joshua Slocum, the Canadian farm boy who became an American seaman, then rose to captain (and what a superb navigator and sailor he was), and later turned into a celebrated world-renowned maritime author...</p><p>There are many mysteries surrounding Capt. Slocum and his life.&nbsp; With this well written and marvelously illustrated book, Stan Grayson has straightened out many of the question marks.&nbsp; The author is to be congratulated for a fascinating biography about a true American legend &#x2013; indeed, what a tale it is.</p> &#x201d;<br> - <strong>Goran Buckhorn, <em>Mystic Seaport Magazine</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Stan Grayson has written what must stand as the definitive biography of Joshua Slocum.&nbsp;Heartfelt, detailed, and lucidly written,&nbsp;<strong><em>A Man for All Oceans</em></strong>&nbsp;casts a revelatory light not only on Slocum but the times in which he lived and sailed.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Nathaniel Philbrick, author of In the Heart of the Sea; Mayflower;&nbsp;and&nbsp;Valiant Ambition</strong><br><br>&#x201c;<strong><em>A Man for All Oceans</em></strong> is a joy to read. Joshua Slocum was an enigmatic individual who achieved a great feat, and Stan Grayson's engaging and well-written book brings both the man and his epic voyage wonderfully to life. Not only mariners, but anyone who appreciates history, will greatly enjoy this enthralling tale of a true American original.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Eric Jay Dolin, author of Brilliant Beacons: A History of the American Lighthouse</strong><br><br>&#x201c;<strong><em>A Man for All Oceans&nbsp;</em></strong>is the most thoroughly researched biography of the masterful and even mystical sailor and author, Captain Joshua Slocum, and as such is unlikely ever to be surpassed.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>W. H. Bunting, author of Sea Struck and Live Yankees</strong><br><br>&#x201c;In his detailed, fascinating biography of a great adventurer and author of the classic&nbsp;<em>Sailing Alone Around the World</em>, Stan Grayson opens up the extraordinary, mysterious life of a captain of the oceans who never could master life on land.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>John Rousmaniere, author of Fastnet, Force 10; After the Storm; and The Annapolis Book of Seamanship</strong><br><br>&#x201c;It isn&#x2019;t just the depth and breadth of research that impresses me, it is the patience and diligence with which the author has gathered together all the pieces of this immensely complicated puzzle. Incident by incident, voyage by voyage, decade by decade, the character of Slocum takes form, grows, is tempered by experience and adversity, achieves flight and fame, and falls victim to the indignities of age and fate.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Llewellyn Howland III, author of No Ordinary Being</strong><br><br>&#x201c; <p>Unless you are an avid sailor, the name Joshua Slocum conjures up, if anything, only a vague story of sailing solo around the world and being lost at sea. In his latest book, Stan Grayson easily convinces the reader that there is much more of interest to the story.</p><p>Slocum&#x2019;s life was extraordinary: a hardscrabble ascent from a failed Nova Scotia farm to hobnobbing with presidents; advancement from the lowly forecastle, &#x201c;through the hawsehole,&#x201d; to world-famous ship&#x2019;s master; finding true love and then true grief; and finally, a heart-rending decline and fall. As far as is positively known, Slocum was last seen departing for a winter sail to the Caribbean. He never returned.</p><p>Grayson started &#x201c;picking at the corners&#x201d; of the story in the mid-1970s. He was very conscious that someone had written what he generously calls a &#x201c;pioneering biography&#x201d; 20 years before. Was there anything more to be said about the great seaman?</p><p>He kept picking away until he had enough new material for a magazine article. But still he couldn&#x2019;t let go, and the &#x201c;ever-widening reach of the Internet&#x201d; fed his habit. The final bonus was a cornucopia of information bequeathed to him by a Slocum relative. The result is &#x201c;A Man for All Oceans,&#x201d; a riveting book.</p><p>The Slocum legend was assiduously promoted by the man himself in &#x201c;Sailing Alone Around the World,&#x201d; and Grayson is judicious in his assessment of the inevitable differences (to use a neutral noun) between saga and evidence. He starts from the premise that, where Slocum &#x201c;concocted, rearranged, or even lied about key events&#x201d; of his life, he had good, though not necessarily obvious, reasons. By trying to unravel them, the historian can &#x201c;gain insight into Slocum&#x2019;s motives, feelings and actions&#x201d; but must &#x201c;tread carefully,&#x201d; Grayson writes. We can never know for sure, just as we will never know exactly what befell Slocum at the end. By placing the known facts of Slocum&#x2019;s life in the fascinating milieu of a sailing tradition struggling to survive, &#x201c;A Man for All Oceans&#x201d; gives a powerful evocation of both.</p> &#x201d;<br> - <strong>Thomas Urquhart, <em>Portland Press Herald</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c; <p>Grayson, whose own writing shines with journalistic polish, admires the writing skills of his subject, praising&nbsp; Slocum&#x2019;s &#x201c;wordsmithing&#x201d; and the &#x201c;clarity that comes from economy.&#x201d; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>Readers will learn much about Joshua Slocum they didn&#x2019;t know in A Man for All Oceans and they will be reminded of something everyone who read Slocum&#x2019;s book could sense: The man simply loved sailing.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Whatever its threat, Slocum believed the sea was to be sailed over,&#x201d; Grayson writes, &#x201c;and he celebrated the pleasure of sailing over the great oceans.&#x201d; &nbsp;</p> &#x201d;<br> - <strong>Bill Schanen, <em>Sailing Magazine</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Joshua Slocum was a rock star in -- and after -- his time...For those who care to experience the full spectrum of Slocum's turbulent life, Grayson's book is a must-read, offering historical context for the amazing voyage recounted in <em>Sailing Alone Around the World</em>.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Sandy Marsters, <em>Points East</em></strong></p><h2>Colorado Cowboy: Includes a bonus novella</h2><p><b>Come home to Topaz Falls, Colorado where a down-on-her-luck bull rider falls for the cowboy she can't resist </b><b>in this heart-warming western romance!</b><br>As a champion barrel racer, Charity Stone has learned to hold her own in the male-dominated rodeo world.

For twenty-five years, the USA and the CSA have been entrenched in an era of simmering hatred, locked in a tangle of blood-soaked battle lines, modern weaponry, desperate strategies, and the kind of violence that only the damned could conjure up for themselves and their enemies. In Richmond, Confederate president and dictator Jake Featherston is shocked by what his own aircraft have done in Philadelphia&#x2014;killing U.S. president Al Smith in a barrage of bombs. Featherston presses ahead with a secret plan carried out on the dusty plains of Texas, where a so-called detention camp hides a far more evil purpose. As the untested U.S. vice president takes over for Smith, the United States face a furious thrust by the Confederate army, pressing inexorably into Pennsylvania.

For nearly three decades a peace forged in blood and fatigue has held sway in North America. Now, Japan dominates the Pacific, the Russian Tsar rules Alaska, and England, under Winston Churchill, chafes for a return to its former glory. But behind the faade of world order, America is a bomb waiting to go off. Jake Featherston, the megalomaniacal leader of the Confederate States of America, is just the man to light the fuse. <br>In the White House in Philadelphia, Socialist President Al Smith is a living symbol of hope for a nation that has been through the fires of war and the flood tides of depression. In the South, Featherston and his ruling Freedom Party have put down a Negro rebellion with a bloody fist and have interned them in concentration camps. Now they are determined to crush their Northern neighbor at any cost. <br>Featherston's planes attack Philadelphia without warning. The U.S.A. lashes back blindly at Charleston. And a terrible second coming is at hand. When the CSA blitzkrieg is launched, the U.S.A. is caught flat-footed. Before long, the gray Army reaches Lake Erie. But in its wake the war machine is spinning a vortex of destruction, betrayal, and fury that no one, not even Jake Featherston himself, can control. <br>Now, President Smith faces a Herculean task, while an obscure assistant secretary of war named Roosevelt rises in his ranks. For the U.S.A., the darkest days still lay ahead. Across the globe, a new era of war has just begun. And in the hands of the incomparable Harry Turtledove, readers are treated to a masterful vision of what might have been.

As Mark Twain, he was the Mississippi riverboat pilot, the satirist with a fiery hatred of pretension, and the author of such classics as Tom Sawyer andHuckleberry Finn. As Mr. Clemens, he was the star who married an heiress, built a palatial estate, threw away fortunes on harebrained financial schemes, and lived the extravagant life that Mark Twain despised. Kaplan effectively portrays the triumphant-tragic man whose achievements and failures, laughter and anger, reflect a crucial generation in our past as well as his own dark, divided, and remarkably contemporary spirit.<br> <br><i>Mr. Clemens and Mark Twain</i> brilliantly conveys this towering literary figure who was himself a symbol of the peculiarly American conflict between moral scrutiny and the drive to succeed. Mr. Clemens lived the Gilded Life that Mark Twain despised. The merging and fragmenting of these and other identities, as the biography unfolds, results in a magnificent projection of the whole man; the great comic spirit; and the exuberant, tragic human being, who, his friend William Dean Howells said, was &#x201c;sole, incomparable, the Lincoln of our literature.&#x201d;</p><p><b>Justin Kaplan</b> is the author of <i>Mr. Clemens and Mark Twain,</i> which was awarded a Pulitzer Prize and a National Book Award, and of <i>Walt Whitman: A Life,</i> which won the American Book Award.

He was one of the best and funniest cartoonists of the earliest iteration of <em>Mad</em> magazine and, thanks to his work on the EC Comics line, he is also widely considered one of America&#x2019;s greatest science-fiction cartoonists.

He also takes us to the wilderness, where we learn from the early monastics as they draw close to God in their solitary discipline. The focus of this book is not liturgy but more broadly worship in its corporate and individual dimensions. We enter into the patristic understanding of baptism and the Eucharist. And we come under the instruction and discipline of great spiritual teachers of prayer. In two previous books, <em>Reading Scripture with the Church Fathers</em> and <em>Learning Theology with the Church Fathers,</em> Christopher Hall has ushered us alongside the church fathers as they study the Scriptures and plumb the depths of theology. In this survey of the spiritual life of worship he informs and challenges Christians in faithful living today. Hall weaves his own experiences into his observations of the fathers' practices and teachings and so helps us close the gap of the centuries. Readers will enjoy a rich and rare schooling in developing their spiritual life.</p><p><strong>Christopher A. Hall</strong> is chancellor of Eastern University in St. Davids, Pennsylvania. He previously served as dean of the Templeton Honors College at Eastern. In addition, he is associate editor of the Ancient Christian Commentary on Scripture."Hall has accomplished an important task for Protestants and Evangelicals by bringing these complex and beautiful texts to light. . . . From cover to cover it is an invitationto consider the beauty and insight of the early Christian tradition of prayer and practice. The richness of the likes of Gregory of Nyssa, Augustine, and John Cassian reach out to any reader--academic, pastoral, or lay." (Joshua Brockway, Brethren Life Thought, Summer and Fall 2010)<br><br>"A specialist on the early church, Hall provides an excellent, readable overview of the worship of the early church." (Ron Sider, Prism, 2010)<br><br>"In <em>Worshiping With the Church Fathers</em>, Hall helps us understand sacraments, prayers, and disciplines and their meaning for the early Church fathers, giving us important keys to enriching our contemporary worship. We gain a sense of history and our connection to the past believers who make up 'a great cloud of witnesses,' plus our worship vocabulary and practice is expanded and deepened." (Worship Leader Magazine, October 2010)<br><br>"In recent years, more and more evangelicals who are looking for spiritual depth and congregational vitality have started to explore the thought and practice of the early church. Christopher Hall is a wise, experienced guide through the twists and turns of this often strange and unfamiliar territory. This volume provides a clear, readable exposition of what the leading church fathers understood about baptism, the Lord's Supper, prayer and spiritual disciplines. A special strength of this book is that Hall explains the biblical and theological reasoning used by the fathers as they developed their approaches. This book is essential reading for pastors, lay leaders and students who are looking for a reliable introduction to the spirituality of the early church." (Jeffrey P. Greenman, associate dean of biblical and theological studies and professor of Christian ethics, Wheaton College)<br><br>"Christopher Hall helps us to read the church fathers contextually and not anachronistically. At the same time he manages to incorporate his own life experiences of worship in ways that make the book deeply personal as all prayer life must be. The result is a rich treasure trove of the prayers of the church." (James M. Houston, founding principal of Regent College, Vancouver, and Emeritus Professor of Spiritual Theology)<br><br>"Christopher Hall's wonderful introduction to prayer and worship in the early church will not only draw you closer to the church fathers--it will draw you closer to God." (Lauren F. Winner, Duke Divinity School, author of Girl Meets God)<br><br>"In the end Christopher Hall has not written a book about the early fathers' views on worship and prayer. Instead, with expertise and humility, he invites us to join an ongoing conversation with Christian siblings who centuries ago reflected on distractions in prayer, self-deception, passions and other concerns central to the Christian life. Chris has mined the ancient resources, uncovered the gems, and set them in a context that makes them highly accessible for consideration by Protestant evangelicals (of which he is one) and all others in the Christian family who want to deepen their understanding and practice of worship and prayer. You won't want to read this book hurriedly as if you were gulping down spiritual junk food. Feast on a richly laden table as you slowly savor each bit of insight and advice from those who have come before us." (Dennis Okholm, professor of theology, Azusa Pacific University, and author of Monk Habits for Everyday People)<br><br>"Many of us who are stumbling to find our way faithfully have looked back to ancient wisdom for direction. Whether we realize it at first, we need guides to navigate these strange landscapes and to discover the treasures they offer for our time. Chris Hall has been such a guide for me. This new volume on worship is a classic example of his ability to help Antony and Augustine, Cassian and Tertullian, speak to us today. Follow Dr. Hall's lead and receive the gifts of this living tradition."

Although insects from this group have long been the bane of those who make their living from the land, grasshoppers, katydids, and crickets are themselves crucial food sources for many species of birds, reptiles and amphibians, and other creatures.</p><p>Field Guide to Grasshoppers, Katydids, and Crickets of the United States introduces readers to the biology, behavior, and ecological significance of one of the most obvious (abundant, large, and colorful) and important (ecologically and economically significant) insect groups in North America, the order Orthoptera. A simple, illustrated identification guide assists the reader in distinguishing among the various groups and narrows down the options to expedite identification. The book treats more than a third of the species found in the United States and Canada in brief, easy-to-understand sections that provide information on distribution, identification, ecology, and similar species. Distribution maps accompany each profile, and 206 species are pictured in color. Black-and-white drawings highlight distinguishing characteristics of some of the more difficult-to-identify species. Sonograms provide a graphic representation of the insects' distinctive sounds, which may be heard on Thomas J. Walker's website: Singing Insects of North America.</p><p>This is the first treatment of North American grasshoppers, katydids, and crickets to portray the insects in full color, and it will be the first time many amateur naturalists and students have the opportunity to see the amazing and colorful world of Orthoptera, because many are cryptically colored (their bright colors evident only in flight) or cryptic in behavior (nocturnal in their habits). John L. Capinera, Ralph D. Scott, and Thomas J. Walker designed their book for amateur naturalists who wish to know the local fauna, for students who seek to identify insects as part of entomology and natural history courses, and for professional biologists who need to identify invertebrates. This invaluable field guide will be a useful supplement for laboratory and field activities and a reference for classrooms at every level.</p></p><p>"Finally--a definitive guide to the identification of grasshoppers, crickets, and their allies from all corners of the country: with this book, a jar, and a sharp ear, alert naturalists can now track down and identify insect songsters."--Darryl T. Gwynne, University of Toronto at Mississauga, author of Katydids and Bush-Crickets: Reproductive Behavior and Evolution of the Tettigoniidae <p>"This book is a great addition to the literature on Orthoptera: broad enough to cover a wide range of insects, but not so broad as to leave out important details. The identification sections of the species accounts are eminently readable, adding to the value of the book and broadening its appeal."--Kevin O'Neill, Montana State University, author of Solitary Wasps: Behavior and Natural History </p><p>"This book is for anyone who has ever hiked or strolled through the open fields and forests of the U.S. in search of solitude and the sounds of nature. A walk in the sun through nearly any open field will put you in aural contact with high pitched `sizzling,' ticking, or buzzing sounds from the many kinds of grasshoppers that inhabit those fields. On those summer days too hot for a stroll, perhaps an evening walk is more congenial: you might hear the very loud buzzes, or soft ticks, of the katydids or the sonorous chirps and trills of the many kinds of crickets that fill the night air with their tonal `songs.' This book will provide readers with the means to deepen their understanding of the exact identity of each singer--it is both fun and challenging to test your ears against a world of sound that is comforting to hear and fascinating to understand. After all, those sounds are mostly produced by males which are singing to attract females for mating and if one is lucky, one can hear territorial and aggression songs produced by contesting males. For the dedicated birders who pride themselves in their ability to pick out birds by their songs alone, here is a new challenge. I can recommend this book for anyone interested in more than a surface understanding of the natural history of a remarkable group of insects--the acoustic insects. Moreover, it's about as authoritative a book as you'll ever find because the authors are unquestionably experts in their field."--Ron Hoy, Cornell University</p><p>John L.

Creator Jef Mallett has given life to Renaissance man / janitor Edwin Frazier, better known as &#34;Frazz,&#34; who took the job at Bryson Elementary School when he was a struggling songwriter. He then surprised everyone by sticking around after selling his first hit song; the school will never be the same. Frazz: Live from Bryson Elementary features the diverse cast of charming characters Frazz readers have come to love. There&#39;s eight-year-old budding genius Caulfield. He&#39;s a constant thorn in the side of burned-out third-grade teacher Mrs. Olsen, who still remembers having Frazz in her class more than 20 years ago. Caulfield needs Frazz to challenge him as he remarks, &#34;School would be OK if it didn&#39;t interfere so much with my education.&#34; Hilariously naive Principal Spaetzle wants to be like Frazz, and first-grade teacher (and first-rate babe!) Miss Plainwell is getting to know him better. And the kids at Bryson Elementary can&#39;t get enough of him!</p><p>Frazz appears in 125 newspapers worldwide, including the Los Angeles Times, Washington Post, Seattle Times, Chicago Tribune, Rocky Mountain News, and Detroit Free Press.

But there remains a critical gap in our knowledge: we still know very little about what happened in the first seconds after the Big Bang. <i>At the Edge of Time</i> focuses on what we have recently learned and are still striving to understand about this most essential and mysterious period of time at the beginning of cosmic history.</p><p>Taking readers into the remarkable world of cosmology, Dan Hooper describes many of the extraordinary and perplexing questions that scientists are asking about the origin and nature of our world. Hooper examines how we are using the Large Hadron Collider and other experiments to re-create the conditions of the Big Bang and test promising theories for how and why our universe came to contain so much matter and so little antimatter. We may be poised to finally discover how dark matter was formed during our universe&#x2019;s first moments, and, with new telescopes, we are also lifting the veil on the era of cosmic inflation, which led to the creation of our world as we know it.</p><p>Wrestling with the mysteries surrounding the initial moments that followed the Big Bang, <i>At the Edge of Time</i> presents an accessible investigation of our universe and its origin.</p></p><p><b>Dan Hooper</b> is a senior scientist and the head of the Theoretical Astrophysics Group at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory and a professor of astronomy and astrophysics at the University of Chicago.

These memoirs, which Bouyer wrote in a humble and humorous vein--though without withholding his notoriously sharp pen when needed--allow the reader to enter with him into the great events that shook the Church and the world during the era of upheavals and transformations through which he lived. They amount to an intelligent, sensitive, and pious man&#x2019;s fascinating chronicle and deep reflection on Christianity&#x2019;s life and travails in a world committed to modernity. Bouyer here tells us the full and varied story of a life devoted to the discovery of the sources and Tradition of the Church in doctrine, spirituality, liturgy, and scripture.<p> We follow Bouyer&#x2019;s journeys from his inherited Protestantism to the fullness of the Catholic Faith, from his position as a Lutheran pastor to the priesthood in the Oratory of France, from humble parish life to the Olympian heights of his official theological and liturgical collaboration (and difficulties) before and after the Council with such influential figures as Congar, Dani�lou, de Lubac, Bugnini, and... Joseph Ratzinger (Benedict XVI). Bouyer paints the lush landscape of a century&#x2019;s illusions and disenchantments; his memoirs are essential for understanding the history of the Church during that momentous time.</p><p> &#x201c;It would be impossible for anyone to speak knowledgeably about liturgical developments in the past 50 years without being cognizant of the work done by Louis Bouyer. His Memoirs, which feature his outspoken opinions and profound intelligence as well as a personality deeply imbued with the true spirit of the Catholic liturgy, can serve as a balance and perhaps an antidote to misinformation about the post-Vatican II developments in the Sacred Liturgy of the Latin Rite. A careful perusal of these Memoirs, now available in English in an excellent translation by John Pepino, also can serve as a corrective to the sometimes unbridled and euphoric optimism that marked liturgical studies in the late 1960s and early 1970s.

A brilliant intellect, he was ordained as a Lutheran pastor at 23. His reflections on the Church and the liturgy led to his conversion to Catholicism in 1939; he was ordained a priest for the Oratory of France on the Feast of the Annunciation in 1944. He then devoted his life to meditating, teaching on three continents, and writing on the major themes of Christian theology: the Trinity, the Church, spirituality, scripture, etc.; his works have had an enduring impact on Catholic theology to this day. He also participated in the liturgical and ecumenical movements with an enthusiasm that turned into disappointment at the direction both movements soon took. His work and reputation led to his appointment to the preparatory phase of Vatican II as well as to the Consilium for the reform of the liturgical books of the Roman rite, where he collaborated in composing Eucharistic prayer II.<br> His literary tastes and talent (he wrote four novels anonymously) allowed him to form deep and lasting friendships with such writers as J.R.R. Tolkien and others, while his clear and courageous theological mind earned him the friendship of Joseph Ratzinger (Benedict XVI), Cardinal Heenan, and Paul VI--who wished to make Bouyer a bishop and later a cardinal.<br><br> In retirement he lived in the Benedictine monastery of Saint Wandrille and would spend the feasts of the Assumption and Christmas among the Benedictine nuns in Jouques.

From our obsession with serial killers to violence in pop culture, we seem inescapably drawn to the stories of monstrous acts and the aberrant people who commit them. But evil, Dr. Julia Shaw argues, is all relative, rooted in our unique cultures. What one may consider normal, like sex before marriage, eating meat, or being a banker, others find abhorrent. And if evil is only in the eye of the beholder, can it be said to exist at all? In <i>Evil</i>, Shaw uses case studies from academia, examples from and popular culture, and anecdotes from everyday life to break down complex information and concepts like the neuroscience of evil, the psychology of bloodlust, and workplace misbehavior.

It soon unfolds, however, that this is no simple case.</p><p>Determined to get to the root of Sam&#x2019;s behaviour, Casey is committed to uncover his mysterious past only to find out something far darker than she ever imagined...</p><p>Having recently said goodbye to their last foster child, Miller, the Watson family are taking a bit of a break. But it&#x2019;s while Casey is having fun catching up with her friends that she receives a call from her new link worker. Social services are desperately trying to find a settled home for nine-year-old Sam, who has Autism and some serious behavioural problems.</p><p>Removed from his mother less than a week ago, Sam has been staying with respite carers. But with two young children of their own, they now find themselves unable to hold on to the little boy as he is bullying them relentlessly. It&#x2019;s not an isolated situation, either. Apparently Sam&#x2019;s own siblings begged not to be placed with their older brother &#x2013; they were both adamant that they were too afraid of him.</p><p>The Watsons agree to accommodate Sam, who, despite his tiny stature, turns out to be quite the whirlwind &#x2013; destroying anything and everything in his path. In addition to the outward behaviours, it quickly becomes evident that there is a much darker past that has blighted the boy&#x2019;s life. As Casey tries to get to the bottom of it, she discovers there are no files on Sam; only the testament of his previous neighbour. Thankfully, Mrs Gallagher is only too happy to help. And to talk. But it soon transpires that there is a great deal more to Sam&#x2019;s secret history...</p></p><p><p>Casey Watson, who writes under a pseudonym, is a specialist foster carer.

They set election ballots ablaze and vanished into the night, but not before planting a red hammer-and-sickle banner in the town square. The lone man arrested the next morning later swore allegiance to a group called Shining Path. The tale of how this ferocious group of guerrilla insurgents launched a decade-long reign of terror, and how brave police investigators and journalists brought it to justice, may be the most compelling chapter in modern Latin American history, but the full story has never been told.</p><p>Described by a U.S. State Department cable as &#x201c;cold-blooded and bestial,&#x201d; Shining Path orchestrated bombings, assassinations, and massacres across the cities, countryside, and jungles of Peru in a murderous campaign to seize power and impose a Communist government. At its helm was the professor-turned-revolutionary Abimael Guzm�n, who launched his single-minded insurrection alongside two women: his charismatic young wife, Augusta La Torre, and the formidable Elena Iparraguirre, who married Guzm�n soon after Augusta&#x2019;s mysterious death. Their fanatical devotion to an outmoded and dogmatic ideology, and the military&#x2019;s bloody response, led to the death of nearly 70,000 Peruvians.</p><p>Orin Starn and Miguel La Serna&#x2019;s narrative history of Shining Path is both panoramic and intimate, set against the socioeconomic upheavals of Peru&#x2019;s rocky transition from military dictatorship to elected democracy. They take readers deep into the heart of the rebellion, and the lives and country it nearly destroyed. We hear the voices of the mountain villagers who organized a fierce rural resistance, and meet the irrepressible black activist Mar�a Elena Moyano and the Nobel Prize&#x2013;winning novelist Mario Vargas Llosa, who each fought to end the bloodshed. Deftly written, <em>The Shining Path</em> is an exquisitely detailed account of a little-remembered war that must never be forgotten.</p> 42 black and white illustrations</p><p><p>Orin Starn is a professor in Duke University&#x2019;s cultural anthropology department and has written for many years about Peru.</p> <p>Miguel La Serna is a historian at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and a leading specialist in the Peruvian armed conflict.</p>&#x201c;<em>The Shining Path</em> is the fascinating account of how one man and two women forged a union to create one of the modern world&#x2019;s most extreme insurgencies. Orin Starn and Miguel La Serna have made a remarkable contribution to our historical knowledge about the origins of the Shining Path and have simultaneously produced a compelling page-turner. They deserve high praise for their achievement.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Jon Lee Anderson, author of <em>Che Guevara: A Revolutionary Life</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;A meticulously researched and harrowing account of how a bookish professor and his two (consecutive) wives conceived and orchestrated a brutal Maoist insurrection in the remote Andes of Peru.

His books have sold more than 6 million copies and have been translated into 20 languages. Renowned for up-to-the-minute content and easy-to-follow steps, all of Hart&#39;s books have become staples for a new generation of aspiring artists and professionals, and they have been selected by the American Library Association for special notice.Reviewed with Christopher Hart's <i>Mecha Mania</i>.<p>Gr. 4-8. Granted, these aren't graphic novels, but they fit right in as many kids want to draw their own comics and create their own stories. By a familiar writer of how-to-draw books, these large-format paperbacks explain the basics of drawing in the style of anime (Japanese animated films) and manga (Japanese comics). Hart's enthusiastic approach energizes the texts, and both books are loaded with full-color illustrations that will surely attract readers. <i>Kids,</i> for the younger end of the audience range,<i></i> moves quickly through the preliminaries of sketching "big-eye" characters' physical attributes, then goes on to demonstrate how to put figures in motion and, using a few successive drawings, how to create some typical characters. Kids who want detailed anime instructions will need to look elsewhere; those who just want some basics will find plenty here. <i>Mech Mania</i>, aimed at older readers with more art experience, focuses on the futuristic robots, vehicles, and weapons found in anime and manga scenes as well as in video games. From the blueprints for a spaceship to advice on showing characters in action or revealing a robot's mood through its posture, this dynamic book offers a useful mix of creative inspiration and practical advice. Hart ends with an informative interview with the art director of Microsoft's Fasa Studio. Slick, heavy paper, vibrant colors, and sharply defined lines in the finished illustrations add to the appeal and make these books sturdier than most paperbacks. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

This beautifully composed narrative continues to attract readers across generations and boundaries of gender, class and ethnicity. In fact, the beauty of the book often distracts from the practical nature of the narrative. For all of its appeal, Ruth is, after all a story about family and survival. The marriage between Ruth and Boaz is a levirate marriage. The goal of this practice is to ensure the continuation and stability of the family line. Thus this &#x201c;charming little whole&#x201d; has as its subject preservation of life in the face of death and upholding memory to ward off the loss of identity. This story of survival is short; it consists of four chapters with elements of loss and recovery; famine and harvest, barrenness and fruitfulness, life and death. These elements afford the book a broad appeal as it speaks to various stages and seasons of life, all the while upholding the power of faithfulness against an ever-changing backdrop. Named after one of the major characters, the book of Ruth tells the story of Naomi of Bethlehem and her family &#x201c;in the days when the judges ruled.&#x201d; ...So much of what happens in Ruth happens where no one can see. Ruth binds herself to Naomi in the &#x201c;in between place&#x201d; of Moab and Judah. No one is there to witness it. Similarly, Ruth asks Boaz for redemption in the middle of the night when we presume everyone else is asleep. These events allow for the inclusion of Ruth as Boaz&#x2019;s people, first as a gleaner and then as a wife. The pattern of what happens away from our observation and then bursts forth where we can see it draws on the images of planting and harvest, conception and birth. On a theological level, it suggests that even in the famine times, God is planting seed, preparing for the next harvest, even when we cannot see it. We must assume then, that whatever we know or recognize about the work of God is only a small piece of the larger whole. We cannot know it all. Chapters: Introduction 1.

Jane Juska is a smart, energetic divorc�e who decided she&#x2019;d been celibate too long, and placed the following personal ad in her favorite newspaper, The New York Review of Books:<br><br>Before I turn 67&#x2014;next March&#x2014;I would like to have a lot of sex with a man I like. If you want to talk first, Trollope works for me. <br><br>This closing reference was a nod to her favorite author, of course. The response was overwhelming, and Juska took a sabbatical from teaching to meet some of the men who had replied. And since her ad made it clear that she wasn&#x2019;t expecting just hand-holding, her dates zipped from first base to home plate in record time. <br><br>Juska is a totally engaging, perceptive writer, funny and frank about her exploits. It&#x2019;s high time someone revealed the fact that older single people are as eager for sex and intimacy as their younger counterparts. Jane Juska&#x2019;s brave, honest memoir will probably raise eyebrows and blood pressure, but it will undoubtedly appeal to the very large audience of grown-up readers who will be fascinated and inspired by her daring adventure.</p><p><b>Advance praise for <i>A Round-Heeled Woman</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Feisty, charming, moving and wise, this page-turner of a memoir proves that life for a woman&#x2014;sexual and otherwise&#x2014;hardly stops at thirty-nine . . . forty-nine or fifty-nine.&#x201d; &#x2014;<b>Cathi</b> <b>Hanauer</b>, editor of <b>The Bitch in the House</b> and author of <b>My Sister&#x2019;s Bones</b><br><br>&#x201c;Juska has a good sense of humor, and of course, her favorite writer is Anthony Trollope.

Joyce Tyldesley&#x2019;s vivid history of how women lived in ancient Egypt weaves a fascinating picture of daily life &#x2013; marriage and the home, work and play, grooming and religion &#x2013; viewed from a female perspective, in a work that is engaging, original and constantly surprising.</p><p>During the dynastic period (3000 BC - 332 BC), as the Greek historian Herodotus was intrigued to observe, Egyptian women enjoyed a legal, social and sexual independence unrivalled by their Greek or Roman sisters, unrivalled, indeed, by women in Europe until the late nineteenth century. They could own and trade in property, work outside the home, marry foreigners and even live alone without the protection of a male guardian. Furthermore, women fortunate enough to be members of the royal harem were vastly influential, as were those rare women who rose to rule Egypt as &#39;female kings&#39;. Joyce Tyldesley draws upon archaeological, historical and ethnographical evidence to piece together a vivid picture of daily life in Egypt - marriage and the home, work and play, grooming, religion - all viewed from a female perspective.

Divided into seven different chapters (including "Rock &amp; Roll Basics," "Punk Rock," and "New Rock Sounds"), this title covers not necessarily the best songs of all time or even the most popular song by a given musician, as the author states in his introduction, but rather those that he believes will resonate with listeners. Along with basic song facts and an artist profile, Hanley includes a "Listening Guide" for each song, closely examining its introduction, verses, and chorus and advising readers to pay attention to aspects such as the insistent guitar riff that opens The Rolling Stones' "(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction" or Stevie Nicks's use of vibrato on Fleetwood Mac's "Landslide." There's a strong interactive element here, too, with users encouraged to make comparisons among singers and bands and to seek out performances on YouTube. Hanley's casual but accessible writing style conveys his enthusiasm for the subject, while photographs and colorful design add to the appeal. Although those seeking a stronger foundation in music history might prefer Robbie Robertson, Sebastian Robertson, Jim Guerinot, and Jared Levine's Legends, Icons &amp; Rebels: Music That Changed the World (Tundra, 2013), Hanley's work is a fun option with an emphasis on song analysis. <b>VERDICT</b> This title will easily spark ideas for programming." <i><b>- School Library Journal</b></i></p></p><h2>Hope: Entertainer of the Century</h2><p>&#x201c;Revelatory...fascinating&#x201d; (<i>The New York Times</i>): The first definitive biography of Bob Hope, featuring exclusive and extensive reporting that makes the persuasive case that he was the most important entertainer of the twentieth century.<br><br>With his topical jokes and his all-American, brash-but-cowardly screen character, Bob Hope was the only entertainer to achieve top-rated success in every major mass-entertainment medium of the century, from vaudeville in the 1920s all the way to television in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s. He virtually invented modern stand-up comedy.

A native of Kansas City, Zoglin currently lives in New York City.Hope INTRODUCTION<p></p> <br>On a balmy October morning in 2010, one hundred people were gathered on a dock in Battery Park at the foot of Manhattan Island. They were a well-dressed group&#x2014;the men in jackets and ties, the women in business suits. Many were quite old and needed help climbing into the boat that had been chartered to ferry them across New York Harbor to Ellis Island. Once there, they made their way to the second floor of the cavernous Immigration Museum building, where rows of chairs had been set up in a long, book-lined room, which was about to be dedicated as the Bob Hope Memorial Library.<br> <br>Linda Hope, the late comedian&#x2019;s seventy-one-year-old daughter, stepped to the microphone to emcee the ceremony. She introduced the smattering of celebrities on hand&#x2014;actress Arlene Dahl, baseball legend Yogi Berra, two US congressmen&#x2014;and several clip reels highlighting Bob&#x2019;s life and career: his childhood years in England, where he was born in 1903, and Cleveland, Ohio, where he and his family emigrated when he was four and a half; scenes from his movies and TV shows; excerpts from his tours to entertain US troops around the globe. His granddaughter, Miranda, accompanying herself on guitar, sang a folk ballad called &#x201c;Immigrant Eyes.&#x201d; Dick Cavett popped up from the audience to tell a couple of impromptu stories about Hope, whom he had befriended in the comedian&#x2019;s later years. Michael Feinstein, the cabaret singer and musical archivist, closed the event with a wistful solo rendition of Bob&#x2019;s theme song, &#x201c;Thanks for the Memory.&#x201d;<br> <br>It was another chapter in what has surely been the most determined campaign of legacy building in Hollywood history. A few months before the Ellis Island ceremony, Hope&#x2019;s family and friends gathered in Washington, DC, to inaugurate a new Hope-centric exhibit on political humor at the Library of Congress, where the comedian&#x2019;s voluminous letters and papers are stored. A year earlier, the Hope legacy tour made a stop on the deck of the USS Midway in San Diego Harbor to mark the introduction of a postage stamp bearing Hope&#x2019;s likeness. Memorials to Hope have proliferated across the American landscape. You can walk down streets named for Bob Hope in El Paso, Texas, Miami, Florida, and Branson, Missouri; cross the Cuyahoga River on the Hope Memorial Bridge in Cleveland, Ohio; and bypass the congestion at Los Angeles International by flying into the Bob Hope Airport in Burbank, California. Hope&#x2019;s name is memorialized on hospitals, theaters, chapels, schools, performing arts centers, and American Legion posts from Miami to Okinawa. The US Air Force named a transport plane for him, and the Navy christened a cargo ship in his honor. Bob Hope Village, in Shalimar, Florida, provides a home for retired members of the Air Force and their surviving spouses. The World Golf Hall of Fame, in St. Augustine, Florida, features an exhibit celebrating Hope&#x2019;s passion for the game, &#x201c;Bob Hope: Shanks for the Memory.&#x201d; A dozen colleges offer scholarships in Hope&#x2019;s name. Another dozen organizations give out awards in his honor, among them the Air Force&#x2019;s annual Spirit of Hope Award and the Bob Hope Humanitarian Award, presented by the Academy of Television Arts &amp; Science.<br> <br>His punchy, two-syllable name, so emblematic of the optimistic American spirit; the unmistakable profile, with its jutting chin and famously ski-slope-shaped nose; the indelible images of Hope performing for throngs of cheering GIs in World War II and Vietnam&#x2014;it was once impossible to imagine a time when the first question that needed to be answered about the most popular comedian in American history would be: Who was Bob Hope, and why did he matter?<br> <br>By the time he died&#x2014;on July 27, 2003, two months after his hundredth birthday&#x2014;Hope&#x2019;s reputation was already fading, tarnished, or being actively disparaged. He had, unfortunately, stuck around too long. The comedian of the century, who began his vaudeville career in the 1920s and was still headlining TV specials in the 1990s, continued performing well into his dotage, and a younger generation knew him mainly as a cue-card-reading antique, cracking dated jokes about buxom beauty queens and Gerald Ford&#x2019;s golf game. &#x201c;World&#x2019;s Last Bob Hope Fan Dies of Old Age,&#x201d; the Onion&#x2019;s fake headline announced a year before his death. Writer Christopher Hitchens expressed the disaffection of many of the baby-boom generation in an online dismissal of Hope just a few days after his passing: &#x201c;To be paralyzingly, painfully, hopelessly unfunny is a serious drawback, even lapse, in a comedian. And the late Bob Hope devoted a fantastically successful and well-remunerated lifetime to showing that a truly unfunny man can make it as a comic. There is a laugh here, but it is on us.&#x201d;<br> <br>Hope never recovered from the Vietnam years, when his hawkish defense of the war, close ties to President Nixon (who actively courted Hope&#x2019;s help in selling his Vietnam policies to the American people), and the country-club smugness of his gibes about antiwar protesters and long-haired hippies, all made him a political pariah for the peace-and-love generation. His tours to entertain US troops during World War II had made him a national hero. By the turbulent 1960s, he was a court-approved jester, the Establishment&#x2019;s comedian&#x2014;hardly a badge of honor in an era when hipper, more subversive comics, from Mort Sahl and Lenny Bruce to George Carlin and Richard Pryor, were showing that stand-up comedy could be a vehicle for personal expression, social criticism, and political protest. Even before Hope became a doddering relic, he had become an anachronism.<br> <br>Yet the scope of Hope&#x2019;s achievement, viewed from the distance of a few years, is almost unimaginable. By nearly any measure, he was the most popular entertainer of the twentieth century, the only one who achieved success&#x2014;often No. 1&#x2013;rated success&#x2014;in every major genre of mass entertainment in the modern era: vaudeville, Broadway, movies, radio, television, popular song, and live concerts. He virtually invented stand-up comedy in the form we know it today. His face, voice, and stage mannerisms (the nose, the lopsided smile, the confident, sashaying walk, and the ever-present golf club) made him more recognizable to more people than any other entertainer since Charlie Chaplin. A tireless stage performer who traveled the country and the world for more than half a century doing live shows for audiences in the thousands, he may well have been seen in person by more people than any other human being in history.<br> <br>His achievements as an entertainer, however, only hint at the breadth and depth of his impact. For the way he marketed himself, managed his celebrity, cultivated his brand, and converted his show-business fame into a larger, more consequential role for himself on the public stage, Bob Hope was the most important entertainer of the century. Viewed from the largest historical perspective&#x2014;the way he intersects with the grand themes of the century, from the Greatest Generation&#x2019;s crusade to preserve democracy in World War II, to the social, political, and cultural upheavals of the 1960s and 1970s&#x2014;one could argue, without too much exaggeration, that he was the only important entertainer.<br> <br>His life almost perfectly spanned the century, and to recount his career is to recapitulate the history of modern American show business. He began in vaudeville, first as a song-and-dance man and then as an emcee and comedian, working his way up from the amateur shows of his Cleveland hometown to headlining at New York&#x2019;s legendary Palace Theatre. He segued to Broadway, where he costarred in some of the era&#x2019;s classic musicals, appeared with legends such as Fanny Brice and Ethel Merman, and introduced standards by great American composers such as Jerome Kern and Cole Porter. Hope became a national star on radio, hosting a weekly comedy show on NBC that was America&#x2019;s No. 1&#x2013;rated radio program for much of the early 1940s and remained in the top five for more than a decade.<br> <br>He came relatively late to Hollywood, making his feature-film debut, at age thirty-four, in The Big Broadcast of 1938, where he sang &#x201c;Thanks for the Memory&#x201d;&#x2014;which became his universally identifiable, infinitely adaptable theme song and the first of many pop standards that, almost as a sideline, he introduced in movies. With an almost nonstop string of box-office hits such as The Cat and the Canary, Caught in the Draft, Monsieur Beaucaire, The Paleface, and the popular Road pictures with Bing Crosby, Hope ranked among Hollywood&#x2019;s top ten box-office stars for a decade, reaching the No. 1 spot in 1949.<br> <br>Hope brought a new kind of character and attitude to the movies. He was the brash but self-mocking wise guy, a braggart who turned chicken in the face of danger, a skirt chaser who quivered like Jell-O when the skirt chased back. &#x201c;I grew up loving him, emulating him, and borrowing from him,&#x201d; said Woody Allen, one of the few comics to acknowledge how much he was influenced by Hope&#x2014;though nearly everyone was. Hope played variations on his cowardly character in spy comedies, ghost stories, costume epics, Westerns&#x2014;but always with a winking nod to the audience, an acknowledgment that he was an actor playing a role. Especially in his interplay with Crosby in the Road films, Hope often spoke directly to the camera or stepped out of character to make cracks about the studio, his career, and his Hollywood friends. This improvisational, fourth-wall-breaking spirit was a radical break from the stylized sophistication of the 1930s romantic comedies, or the artifice of other vaudeville comics who transitioned into movies, such as W. C. Fields or the Marx Brothers. And it perfectly met the psychological needs of a nation at a time of war and world crisis. As the newsreels broadcast scenes of thundering European dictators, jackbooted military troops, and docile, mindlessly cheering crowds, Hope&#x2019;s humor was both an escape and an affirmation of the American spirit: feisty, independent, indomitable.<br> <br>When television came in, Hope was there too. Others, such as Milton Berle, preceded him. But after starring in his first NBC special on Easter Sunday in 1950, Hope began an unparalleled reign as NBC&#x2019;s most popular comedy star that lasted for nearly four decades. Other comedians who made the move into television&#x2014;Berle, Jack Benny, Red Skelton, Jackie Gleason, Danny Thomas, even Lucille Ball&#x2014;had their heyday on TV and then faded; Hope alone remained a major star headlining top-rated TV shows well into his eighties. His 1970 Christmas special from Vietnam was the most watched television program of all time up to that point, seen in a now-unthinkable 46.6 percent of all TV homes in the country. (The final episodes of Dallas, M*A*S*H, and Roots are the only entertainment shows ever to beat it.)<br> <br>That would have been enough for most performers, but not Hope. Along with his radio, TV, and movie work, he traveled for personal appearances at a pace matched by no other major star. He was just one of many performers who went overseas on USO-sponsored tours to entertain the troops during World War II. Unlike most of the others, he didn&#x2019;t stop when the war ended. Starting with a trip to Berlin during a Cold War crisis in 1948, he launched an annual tradition of entertaining US troops around the world at Christmas&#x2014;in wartime and peacetime, from forlorn outposts in Alaska to the battlefields of Korea and Vietnam. Stateside, he was just as indefatigable, making as many as 250 personal appearances a year, manning the microphone at charity benefits, trade shows, state fairs, testimonial dinners, hospital dedications, Boy Scout jamborees, Kiwanis Club luncheons, and seemingly any event that could pack a thousand people into a ballroom on the promise that Bob Hope would be there to deliver the one-liners.<br> <br>On a podium, no one could touch him. He was host or cohost of the Academy Awards ceremony a record nineteen times&#x2014;the first in 1940, when Gone With the Wind was the big winner, and the last in 1978, when Star Wars and Annie Hall were the hot films. His suave unflappability&#x2014;no one ever looked better in a tuxedo&#x2014;and tart insider wisecracks (&#x201c;This is the night when war and politics are forgotten, and we find out who we really hate&#x201d;) helped turn a relatively low-key industry dinner into the most obsessively tracked and massively watched event of the Hollywood year.<br> <br>The modern stand-up comedy monologue was essentially his creation. There were comedians in vaudeville before Hope, but they mostly worked in pairs or did prepackaged, jokebook gags that played on ethnic stereotypes and other familiar comedy tropes. Hope, working as an emcee and ad-libbing jokes about the acts he introduced, developed a more freewheeling and spontaneous monologue style, which he later honed and perfected in radio. To keep his material fresh, he hired a team of writers and told them to come up with jokes about the news of the day&#x2014;presidential politics, Hollywood gossip, California weather, as well as his own life, work, travels, golf game, and show-business friends.<br> <br>This was something of a revolution. When Hope made his debut on NBC in 1938, the popular comedians on radio all inhabited self-contained worlds, playing largely invented comic characters: Jack Benny&#x2019;s effete tightwad, Edgar Bergen and his uppity dummy, Charlie McCarthy, the daffy-wife/exasperated-husband interplay of George Burns and Gracie Allen. Hope&#x2019;s monologues brought something new to radio: a connection between the comedian and the outside world.<br> <br>Hope was not the first comedian to do jokes about current events. Will Rogers, the Oklahoma-born humorist who offered folksy and often pointed commentary on politics and the American scene, achieved huge popularity in vaudeville, movies, and radio in the 1920s and 1930s, before his death in a plane crash in 1935. Fred Allen, the frog-voiced radio satirist, was aiming acerbic and literate barbs at the potentates of both Washington and his own network while Hope was still apprenticing. But Hope was the first to combine topical subject matter with the rapid-fire gag rhythms of the vaudeville quipster. His monologues became the template for Johnny Carson and nearly every late-night TV host who followed him, and the foundation stone for all stand-up comics, even those who rebelled against him.<br> <br>Hope wasn&#x2019;t a political satirist. His jokes never hit hard, cut deep, or betrayed any political viewpoint. Mostly they took personalities and events from the news and lampooned them for superficial things, or with clever wordplay&#x2014;an ironic juxtaposition or unexpected twist or jokey hyperbole. &#x201c;Not much has been happening back home,&#x201d; Hope told a crowd of servicemen after the 1960 presidential election. &#x201c;Hawaii and Alaska joined the union, and the Republicans left it.&#x201d; He poked fun at new California governor Ronald Reagan for his Hollywood pedigree, not his conservative politics: &#x201c;California&#x2019;s back to a two-party system: the Democrats and the Screen Actors Guild.&#x201d; When Bobby Kennedy was thinking of running for president, Hope joked about the candidate&#x2019;s growing brood of kids: &#x201c;He may win the next election without leaving the house.&#x201d; On hot-button issues such as gay rights, Hope&#x2019;s gags amiably skirted any potential land mines: &#x201c;In California homosexuality is legal. I&#x2019;m getting out before they make it mandatory.&#x201d;<br> <br>He was the first comedian to openly acknowledge that he used writers&#x2014;as many as a dozen at a time, turning out hundreds of potential jokes for each monologue.

In this five-book series, Jean Hugard, master performer on stage and with small groups, teaches the passes, palming methods, shuffles, arm spreads, color reverses, sleights, flourishes, set-ups, and tricks in the best professional versions. After showing the basic manipulations, he develops a number of exceptional tricks where the manipulations are used. A number of illustrations and step-by-step explanations teach each detail as the trick would be given in a performance. By working through these tricks, from the simple to the complex, the magician learns his skills in a professional manner and also&nbsp;gains a wide repertoire of specific tricks. Throughout the book a great number of manipulations and over a hundred tricks are explained. <br>The keys to these tricks are not well known outside professional magicians' groups. But to the advanced beginner or semiprofessional who has some degree of card skill, the manipulations and tricks developed in this book will add to the dexterity of the performance, give hours of rigorous skill-developing practice, and help build a professional, well-rounded repertoire with cards. <br>"Recommended." &#x2014; <i>Linking Ring</i>.</p><p></p><h2>St. Paul&#x2019;s Historic Summit Avenue (Fesler-Lampert Minnesota Heritage)</h2><p>Well known as the most prestigious and beautiful street in the Twin Cities, Summit Avenue runs past the opulent mansion of railroad tycoon James J.

Lenin&#x2019;s originality and importance as a revolutionary leader is most often associated with the seizure of power in 1917. But, in this new study and collection of Lenin&#x2019;s original texts, Slavoj i ek argues that his true greatness can be better grasped in the last two years of his political life. Russia had survived foreign invasion, embargo and a terrifying civil war, as well as internal revolts such as the one at Kronstadt in 1921. But the new state was exhausted, isolated and disorientated. As the anticipated world revolution receded into the distance, new paths had to be charted if the Soviet state was to survive.<br><br> With his characteristic brio and provocative insight, i ek suggests that Lenin&#x2019;s courage as a thinker can be found in his willingness to face this reality of retreat unflinchingly. In today&#x2019;s world, characterized by political turbulence, economic crises and geopolitical tensions, we should revisit Lenin&#x2019;s combination of sober lucidity and revolutionary determination.</p></p><p><b>Slavoj &#x17d;i&#x17e;ek</b> is a Slovenian philosopher and cultural critic.

Formerly chairman of the Venice in Peril Fund, he now heads the World Monuments Fund in Britain.<b>Chapter I</b><br><br><b>Beginnings</b><br>The Mediterranean is a miracle. Seeing it on the map for the millionth time, we tend to take it for granted; but if we try to look at it objectively we suddenly realise that here is something utterly unique, a body of water that might have been deliberately designed, like no other on the surface of the globe, as a cradle of cultures. Almost enclosed by its surrounding lands, it is saved from stagnation by the Straits of Gibraltar, those ancient Pillars of Hercules which protect it from the worst of the Atlantic storms and keep its waters fresh and &#x2013; at least until recent years &#x2013; unpolluted. It links three of the world's six continents; its climate for much of the year is among the most benevolent to be found anywhere.<br><br>Small wonder, then, that the Middle Sea should not only have nurtured three of the most dazzling civilisations of antiquity, and witnessed the birth or blossoming of three of our greatest religions; it also provided the principal means of communication. Roads in ancient times were virtually nonexistent; the only effective method of transport was by water, which had the added advantage of being able to support immense weights immovable by any other means. The art of navigation may have been still in its infancy, but early sailors were greatly assisted by the fact that throughout much of the eastern Mediterranean it was possible to sail from port to port without ever losing sight of land; even in the western, a moderately straight course was all that was necessary to ensure an arrival on some probably friendly coast before many days had passed.(1) To be sure, life at sea was never without its dangers. The <i>mistral </i>that screams down the Rh�ne valley and lashes the Gulf of Lyons to a frenzy, the <i>bora</i> in the Adriatic that can make it almost impossible for the people of Trieste to walk unassisted down the street, the <i>gregale</i> in the Ionian that has ruined many a winter cruise &#x2013; all these could spell death for the inexperienced or unwary. Even the mild <i>meltemi</i> in the Aegean, usually a blessing to ships under sail, can transform itself within an hour into a raging monster and drive them on to the rocks. True, there are no Atlantic hurricanes or Pacific typhoons, and for most of the time &#x2013; given a modicum of care &#x2013; the going is easy enough; still, there was no point in taking unnecessary risks, so the earliest Mediterranean seafarers kept their journeys as short as possible.<br><br>When possible, too, they kept to the northern shore. To most of us today, the map of the Mediterranean is so familiar that we can no longer look at it objectively. If, however, we were to see it for the first time, we should be struck by the contrast between the littorals to the north and south. That to the north is full of incident, with the Italian and Balkan peninsulas flanked by three seas &#x2013; Tyrrhenian, Adriatic and Aegean &#x2013; and then that extraordinary conformation of the extreme northeast corner, where the Dardanelles lead up to the little inland Sea of Marmara, from the eastern end of which the city of Istanbul commands the entrance to the Bosphorus and ultimately to the Black Sea. The southern coast, by contrast, is comparatively featureless, with few indentations; there one is always conscious, even in the major cities, that the desert is never far away.<br><br>One of the many unsolved questions of ancient history is why, after countless millennia of caveman existence, the first glimmerings of civilisation should have made their appearance in widely separated areas at much the same time. Around the Mediterranean that time is, very roughly, about 3000 BC. It is true that Byblos (the modern Jbeil, some fifteen miles north of Beirut), which gave its name to the Bible - the word actually means papyrus - was settled in palaeolithic times and is believed by many to be considerably older still; indeed, it may well be the oldest continuously inhabited site in the world. But the remains of a few one-room huts and a crude idol or two can hardly be considered civilisation, and there as elsewhere nothing much really happens until the coming of the Bronze Age at the beginning of the third millennium BC. Then at last things start to move. There are some extraordinary monolithic tombs in Malta dating from about this time, and others in Sicily and Sardinia, but of the people who built them we know next to nothing. The three great cultures that now emerge have their origins a good deal further east: in Egypt, Palestine and Crete.<br><br>Of the traditional Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, only the oldest, the Pyramids of Egypt, survives today; and there is little doubt that they will still be standing five thousand years hence. The most venerable of all, the step pyramid at Saqqara, is said to date from 2686 BC; the grandest and noblest, that of the Pharaoh Khufu &#x2013; known to Herodotus and so, normally, to us as Cheops &#x2013; from a century later. Their longevity should cause us no surprise; their shape alone is almost enough to confer immortality. No buildings in the world are less top&#x2013;heavy. Not even an earthquake could seriously shake them. Gazing up at them, one is dumbfounded by the sheer magnitude of the achievement, and of the underlying ambition: that a man, nearly five thousand years ago, should take it upon himself to build a mountain, and succeed in doing so. Only twenty&#x2013;five years later, Cheops&#x2019;s son Chefren built another, connected to a monumental hall of alabaster and red granite, along the walls of which were twenty&#x2013;three seated statues of himself. Finally, he commissioned the Sphinx. It may well be his portrait; it can certainly claim to be the oldest piece of monumental sculpture &#x2013; it is actually carved from an outcrop of rock &#x2013; known to man. <br><br>Egypt, having started so early, was always slow to change. Cheops and Chefren belonged to the Fourth Dynasty; of the first three we know nothing but the names of some of the rulers. The last dynasty was the Thirty-First, which ended in 335 bc with the conquest of the country by the Persians; three years later they in their turn were thrown out by Alexander the Great. Alexander did not linger - he never did - but marched on to Mesopotamia and the further east. After his death in 323 Egypt passed to his former general, Ptolemy, whose line, more Greek than Egyptian, continued for another three centuries. Thus, from the shadowy beginnings with the First Dynasty until the death of Cleopatra in 30 BC, there extended a period of more than three thousand years; yet the untutored eye, balefully staring at relief carvings on the walls of tombs or at endless columns of hieroglyphics, finds it hard to distinguish the art of one millennium from that of the next.<br><br>Nonetheless, a few other great names imprint themselves on the memory: Queen Hatshepsut (1490-69 BC), for example, who, though technically only regent for her stepson and nephew Thutmose III, completed the temple at Karnak - erecting two obelisks there to commemorate the fact - and decorated the awe-inspiring pink granite temple of Deir el-Bahri at Thebes, on the walls of which she is represented as a man; Thutmose himself, who on her death in 1469, in what seems to have been a paroxysm of vindictive spite, ordered every portrait of her to be defaced and every inscription bearing her name chiselled away, but who later extended the bounds of his kingdom to the upper reaches of the Euphrates and proved himself - by his talents as general, lawgiver, builder and patron of the arts - one of the greatest of the pharaohs; Amenhotep IV, better known as Akhnaton (1367-50 BC) - instantly recognisable by his long, narrow, pointed face, stooping body and huge thighs - a religious fanatic who forbade the worship of the Theban sun god Amon, instituting instead that of the solar disc Aton, its rays as depicted ending in tiny hands outstretched to bless (or curse); his son-in-law and second successor the boy king Tutankhamun (1347-39 BC), who reverted to the old religion but would be obscure enough today were it not for Howard Carter's discovery on 5 November 1922 of his tomb, the sarcophagus almost invisible beneath the higgledy-piggledy piles of golden treasure - treasure which is to this day the chief glory of the Cairo Museum; and Rameses II, the Great (1290-24 BC), the megalomaniac who erected statues of himself all over Egypt and Nubia and may well have been the Pharaoh of the Exodus - though scholars are still arguing about this, and will continue to do so for many years to come. Finally we must make special mention of Akhnaton's queen, Nefertiti, whose bust - found in the excavated studio of an ancient craftsman in her husband's capital of Tell-el-Amarna and now in Berlin - suggests that she was one of the most ravishingly beautiful women who ever lived.1 Neither the Greeks nor the Romans, nor even the greatest sculptors of the Italian Renaissance, were ever to portray her equal. If ancient Egypt had produced no other work of art than this, those three millennia would still have been worth while.<br><br>Another reason for the strange timelessness of Egypt is its astonishing geography. Seen from the air, it looks exactly like a map of itself: vast expanses of yellow, with a thin blue-green line snaking up from the south, and a narrow border of green along each side before the yellow takes over again. To Egypt, the Nile is like the sun: a necessity to continuing national life in a way that no other river could ever be, as essential as a breathing tube to a deep-sea diver. In such conditions there is little opportunity for change; outside Cairo, Alexandria and one or two of the larger towns, life in most of Egypt carries on very much as it always has. There are few greater travelling pleasures than to board the night sleeper from Cairo to Luxor, and to awake early the next morning to find oneself moving at about ten miles an hour along the riverbank, while just outside the train window, golden in the early sunlight, there passes scene after scene straight out of a Victorian child&#x2019;s geography book.<br><br>From earliest times the Egyptians were a single, coherent state; their Phoenician contemporaries seem to have made no attempt ever to create one. Though they were compulsive travellers, their home was Palestine. The Old Testament refers to the people of Tyre and Sidon, of Byblos and Arwad (this last situated further up the coast, roughly opposite the southern shore of Cyprus). All four communities sprang up around 1550 BC, and all four were ports, the Phoenicians being essentially a maritime people. We read in the First Book of Kings how Hiram, King of Tyre, sent King Solomon timber and skilled craftsmen for the building of the Temple in Jerusalem, but for the most part he and his subjects stuck to the narrow coastal strip between the mountains of Lebanon and the sea. They had developed one memorable home industry: gathering the shells of the murex, a form of mollusc which secreted a rich purple dye, worth far more than its weight in gold.(1) But their principal interest lay always in the lands to the west - with whom, however, they traded more as a loose confederation of merchant communities than as anything resembling a nation.<br><br>Today we remember the Phoenicians above all as seafarers, a people who sailed to every corner of the Mediterranean and quite often beyond. Herodotus tells us that in about 600 BC, at the behest of Pharaoh Necho, they circumnavigated the continent of Africa. If he was right (or nearly so), this was an achievement which would not be repeated for more than two thousand years. (If, on the other hand, he was wrong, how did he know - or even believe - that it was circumnavigable?) There is little doubt, in any case, that Hiram and Solomon participated in occasional voyages from Ezion-Geber (near the modern Eilat) to the fabled Ophir, which - though nobody seems quite sure - was probably on the Sudanese or Somali coast. At other times Phoenician merchants established trading colonies at Mozia in Sicily, Ibiza in the Balearic Islands and along the shores of North Africa. They then passed through the Straits of Gibraltar to explore the Atlantic ports of both Spain and Morocco; they certainly had an outpost on the promontory of Cadiz, protected by its surrounding marshes. We are told that a certain Himilco even crossed the English Channel, landing on the south coast of Britain (probably Cornwall) in quest of tin. The Phoenicians remained an important economic force in the Mediterranean until the end of the eighth century bc, when they were overshadowed first by the growing might of Assyria, and then by that of the Greeks. <br><br>Thanks above all to the luxury goods which they provided, they were also a force for civilisation. From their Levantine home, as well as from Cyprus, Egypt, Anatolia and Mesopotamia, they would bring ivory and rare woods, superb drinking vessels of gold and silver, flasks of glass and alabaster, seals and scarabs of precious and semiprecious stone. But their greatest gift to posterity was unconnected to trade or navigation; it was they, almost certainly, who first evolved an alphabet. Hieroglyphics in the Egyptian manner were all very well, but they were slow to write, frequently ambiguous to read and incapable of expressing subtle shades of meaning. The invention of a system whereby any spoken word could be represented by a small group of letters drawn from a repertoire of a couple of dozen was an immeasurably great step forward, and there is little doubt that this step was first taken by a group of Semitic-speaking people on the eastern shore of the Mediterranean. The earliest clearly readable alphabetic inscription, found at Byblos, probably dates from the eleventh century BC, but primitive versions of the alphabet - consisting entirely of consonants - were in use several centuries before that; if we date the original invention to somewhere between 1700 and 1500 BC we shall not be very far wrong. In due course this alphabet was first adopted, then adapted by the Greeks; it can thus be seen as the rude forefather of our own.<br>As the pyramids were being built in Egypt, the people of Crete were also beginning to stir. Men there were working in copper and bronze, but more interesting are the early knives made of obsidian - that strange volcanic glass, usually coal-black, which when chipped produces an edge like a razor - because obsidian had to be imported, probably from Anatolia, and imports mean trade. Archaeologists have found objects from still further afield - ivory, rock crystal and semiprecious stones - of only slightly later dates. By 2000 BC Crete seems to have become the commercial crossroads of the eastern Mediterranean - we have it from no less an authority than Odysseus himself (1) that during the spring and summer the winds in the Aegean made it possible to cross from Crete to Egypt in only five days - and the island's two greatest palaces, at Knossos and Phaestos, were rapidly taking shape.<br><br>Crete's Windsor Castle is the palace of Knossos, where the first excavations by Sir Arthur Evans began in 1899. Small, swarthy and immensely strong, Evans gave the best years of his life to the palace, and very remarkable it is: it covers a vast area, well over 10,000 square metres; parts of it were three or even four storeys high; and the plumbing seems to have been better than anything known in Europe before the nineteenth century.</p><h2>Your Rabbit: A Kid&#39;s Guide to Raising and Showing</h2><p><p>Designed for children ages 9 and up who are interested in raising rabbits, this comprehensive guide covers all aspects of rabbit care with an encouraging tone and age-appropriate language.

Early chapters on creativity and story would appeal to anyone interested in breaking through self-imposed boundaries, by encouraging the writer to "set yourself the task to write not only what you know but more especially what you don't know." We've all heard this before, but Deena Metzger (<i>A Sabbath Among the Ruins</i>) provides such resonant anecdotes and enticing exercises that it begins to seem not only doable but fun. "Even when writing about ourselves or an event that we know well," she says, "we sometimes find that the story ... is taking a direction we never expected. As it is always possible to come back to the known, it is politic, under these circumstances, to see where the story wants to go." Later chapters help writers access their inner worlds through meditation, spirit guides, mythology, tarot cards, the muse, visions, nature, and dreams. To follow Metzger's book closely requires a great deal of hard but rewarding, work. "Maintaining a spiritual practice is an ordeal like climbing a mountain," Metzger warns, "and it demands the same of us: commitment, discipline, endurance, focus, and awareness. There at the top is the sky and, perhaps, the large vision, but ultimately the meaning is in the climbing." <i>--Jane Steinberg</i>Poet, novelist ( What Dinah Thought, LJ 8/89), teacher, and therapist, Metzger presents unique writing exercises geared to liberate one's creativity from the rational mind. She progresses from a series of questions producing self-knowledge to others that result in stories and novels. Metzger is most engaging when she is offering concrete advice and examples from her friends' and students' writings instead of dispensing mystic philosophy. She lost this reviewer in Part 3, where she instructs the reader to meditate in order "to contact the wisest part of yourself and allow it to coalesce into a mythic or historic figure " to serve as an inner guide. However, all readers of this self-help book should be able to find some method here that best allows them to unlock their suppressed imaginations and write more freely.<br><i>- Cathy Sabol, Northern Virginia Community Coll., Manassas</i><br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Book In A Box Method: The Groundbreaking New Way to Write and Publish Your Book</h2><p><b>Everything you've ever been told about how to write a book is wrong.</b> <br><br> Authors assume that writing a book needs to be a struggle.

The method used by Brunswick and Mazlish is to select twenty-five or more key persons or events and to weave the whole chronicle of Western thought from Leonardo to Heel (inclusive) around them. Their work is therefore less abstract than some histories of thought of a similar compass, since it does not hesitate to deal with specific persons and even political events: intellectual history is not reduced to themes and elements. The individual chapters, since they are really examples, present the newest learned evidence with some detail and even indicate the scholarly controversies that are involved. References to the learned literature in these essays are invariably apt...<p>Bruce Mazlish is professor emeritus of history at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and fellow of The American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

Max (Karl Ernst Ludwig) Planck was a German physicist and philosopher known for his quantum theory, for which he won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1918. Planck was born in Kiel, Germany, in 1858 to an academic family, and he valued education from a young age. He attended the Universities of Munich and Berlin to study physics under the great scientific leaders Kirchhoff and Helmholtz. His early work mainly focused on the study of thermodynamics, and in 1900 he published a paper on his quantum theory that would change the face of modern physics. Planck worked as a professor at Berlin University his entire life, and he also served as the president of the Kaiser Wilhelm Society for the Promotion of Science. During World War II, Planck experienced great hardships while he remained in Germany but openly opposed the Nazi regime. One of his two sons was executed during this time for an unsuccessful attempt on Hitler&#x2019;s life, and Planck&#x2019;s home in Berlin was eventually bombed. He continued to write on physics and philosophy until his death in 1947.</p><p></p><h2>Cognitive Gadgets: The Cultural Evolution of Thinking</h2><p><p><b>&#x201c;This is an important book and likely the most thoughtful of the year in the social sciences... Highly recommended, it is likely to prove one of the most thought-provoking books of the year.&#x201d;&#x2015;Tyler Cowen, <i>Marginal Revolution</i></b></p><p>How did human minds become so different from those of other animals? What accounts for our capacity to understand the way the physical world works, to think ourselves into the minds of others, to gossip, read, tell stories about the past, and imagine the future? These questions are not new: they have been debated by philosophers, psychologists, anthropologists, evolutionists, and neurobiologists over the course of centuries. One explanation widely accepted today is that humans have special cognitive instincts. Unlike other living animal species, we are born with complicated mechanisms for reasoning about causation, reading the minds of others, copying behaviors, and using language.</p><p>Cecilia Heyes agrees that adult humans have impressive pieces of cognitive equipment. In her framing, however, these cognitive gadgets are not instincts programmed in the genes but are constructed in the course of childhood through social interaction. Cognitive gadgets are products of cultural evolution, rather than genetic evolution. At birth, the minds of human babies are only subtly different from the minds of newborn chimpanzees. We are friendlier, our attention is drawn to different things, and we have a capacity to learn and remember that outstrips the abilities of newborn chimpanzees. Yet when these subtle differences are exposed to culture-soaked human environments, they have enormous effects. They enable us to upload distinctively human ways of thinking from the social world around us.</p><p>As <i>Cognitive Gadgets</i> makes clear, from birth our malleable human minds can learn through culture not only what to think but how to think it.</p></p><p>Cecilia Heyes is Senior Research Fellow in Theoretical Life Sciences and Professor of Psychology at All Souls College, University of Oxford.&#x201c;This is an important book and likely the most thoughtful of the year in the social sciences...

Through lucid, compelling writing, this masterly exegesis proposes that the key features of the human mind, termed &#x2018;cognitive gadgets,&#x2019; are the products of cultural rather than genetic evolution.

Cecilia Heyes argues that culture is the prime mover, upgrading the mind by installing a cascade of &#x2018;gadgets&#x2019;&#x2015;non-genetic innovations that enable imitation, mind-reading, episodic memory, and more. <i>Cognitive Gadgets</i> is an elegant, compelling, and groundbreaking work that should be read by anyone interested in what we are and how we came to be.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Andy Clark, University of Edinburgh</b><br><br>&#x201c;<i>Cognitive Gadgets</i> is a terrific book. Heyes makes a very surprising claim, arguing that human cognitive capacities&#x2015;language, technical and causal intelligence, and the capacity to understand others&#x2015;are not built by natural selection, but are instead cultural adaptations, installed by social learning. It is a richly informed, beautifully clear, and lucidly argued case.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Kim Sterelny, Australian National University</b><br><br>&#x201c;Evolutionary psychology has been plagued by theories that are interesting but not testable, and theories that are testable but not interesting. In her exposition of cognitive gadgets, Heyes escapes from this trap. By emphasizing specific mechanisms, she makes precise predictions about what makes human cognition unique, and demonstrates that human culture is not just about accumulating knowledge&#x2015;it also enables each of us to learn how to think.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Chris Frith, University College London</b><br><br>&#x201c;How much of what is distinctively human depends on our biological (genetic) evolution and how much is culturally influenced or learned?

He has visited over 400 elementary schools, dozens of writers conferences, and taught many writing classes. He has four children and lives with his wife Jennifer and their Border Collie, Pepper, in a windy valley of the Rocky Mountains.Gr 4&#x2013;8&#x2014;Young lovers of dystopian steampunk may be intrigued by Savage's latest offering to the genre. Mysteries take readers underground to the cryptic Cove, a subterranean, multilevel city not unlike District 13 in Suzanne Collins's "The Hunger Games" (Scholastic) books or the "community" in Lois Lowry's The Giver (HMH, 1993), with a dash of "here be dragons" flavor for good measure. Trenton Coleman, the story's middle school-age protagonist, finds his chances of becoming one of the city's mechanics jeopardized after breaking the strictest law: that no "inventions" shall be made by anyone. The creative Trenton breaks the law, making an unapproved "device." His penance leads him to a startling discovery, and with the help of the contradictory, rule-thwarting Katrina, Trenton searches for the reason the Cove has banned all invention. As his quest deepens, he unearths more than he bargains for. While Savage's premise is interesting, heavy use of mechanical jargon and feeble character development distract from an otherwise intriguing plot. Lengthy and detailed descriptions of gears, bolts, nuts, and levers will dizzy unaccustomed readers. The compelling story arc fails to compensate for the flat, inaccessible Trenton and the fuzzily defined Katrina. Their flinty relationship, meant to be mutually sharpening, is a tiresome exercise in a youthful scuffle of wills.

Johnson's simple yet powerful approach avoids the paralyzing trap of guilt, blame, anger, and defensive denial that often results from conversations about gender.<br> &nbsp;<br> This edition features:<br> * Updated references, data, resources, and examples, especially in relation to issues of sexual orientation and gender identity (e.g., gay marriage, transgender)<br> * A glossary of terms<br> * A new chapter, "What Changes and What Does Not: Manhood and Violence," that provides an extended analysis of the causes of men's violence as a patriarchal phenomenon&nbsp;</p><p>A compelling approach to gender inequality that empowers both men and women to be part of the solution instead of just part of the problem<br>Praise for the first edition: <p>"A powerful approach to gender inequality that empowers both men and women to be part of the solution instead of just part of the problem. The Gender Knot belongs on the reading list of every course in sexual politics that encourages students to engage (if not 'smash') patriarchy meaningfully." &#x2014;Men and Masculinities </p><p>"As any knitter will tell you, the way to untangle a knot is not to pull hard on one end, but gently shake the entire skein until all the threads are loosened. In this book, Allan Johnson gently and patiently shakes the patriarchal knot until each of the constituent threads becomes analytically clear. In doing so, he gives men a way to be part of unraveling that oppressive knot, rather than simply tugging defensively on their end." &#x2014;Michael Kimmel, author of Manhood in America: A Cultural History </p><p>"This is a good book.

Chaon mines the psychological landscape of his characters to dazzling effect. Each story radiates with sharp humor, mystery, wonder, and startling compassion. <i>Among the Missing</i> lingers in the mind through its subtle grace and power of language.</p><p>Dan Chaon opens his new collection of stories with an epigraph from Raymond Carver: "Whatever this was all about, it was not a vain attempt--journey." This is pretty opaque stuff from Carver, a writer not much given to mystification. But it strikes just the right note for Chaon's assembly of characters, a group vaguely unsettled by life, trying to make the best of it. First and foremost, this is a book beset by moms. You get the feeling that the characters in <i>Among the Missing</i> never really had a chance to figure out the world, with these cryptic, uncommunicative women to care for them. In the title story, for example, a car is discovered at the bottom of a local lake, with an entire family drowned inside. The college-age narrator, however, is preoccupied by the more mundane puzzle of his parents' relationship. "Somehow," he recounts, "they'd stayed married for twenty years, and then, abruptly, somehow they'd decided to give up. It didn't quite make sense, and I looked at them, for a minute aware of the other mystery in my life. 'Do you want some soup?' my mother asked, as if I were a customer."<p> That's about as much as you'll ever get out of one of Chaon's mothers: soup. When not fielding their aging parents' passivity, these characters seem to spend a lot of time grappling with ghosts. The "missing" of the title story are, literally, gone. In "Safety Man," a widow comes to rely on one of those inflatable dolls meant to intimidate intruders. In "Prosthesis," a young wife and mother falls for a stranger with a missing arm; meanwhile, she watches her son grow up and away from her, "disappearing into his own thoughts and feelings." In the end, Chaon is the rare writer who deserves comparison to Carver: both write an affectless prose that takes on a surprisingly emotional life of its own. <i>--Claire Dederer</i></p>&#x201c;One of the best short story writers around . . .

This view of philosophy implies two doctrines central to the Platonic tradition: the immortality of the soul and the community (koinonia) of the human and divine. These ideas were not new with Plato nor did they die with him. It is the nature of the philosophical endeavor to borrow and transform the ideas of others and to pass these ideas on for others to use and adapt. Plato is arguably the single most important ancient Greek thinker, although his strength lies not merely in his innovation but also, and perhaps especially, in his critical understanding of the philosophical tradition. The Golden Chain provides important texts in the history of Platonism. It begins, perhaps startlingly but certainly correctly, with excerpts about Pythagoras, moves through the Pythagorean tradition, then comes to Plato himself, and continues with excerpts from the major Neoplatonist writers. What unfolds is an evolution of a philosophy, a Platonic philosophy, one that starts before Plato is born and continues to grow after his death&#x2014;and indeed well beyond the times and writings of the pagan Neoplatonists presented here. We do not know much about Pythagoras. Given his fame and large numbers of followers, that may seem strange. We know of multiple biographies of him (four of which are excerpted in Part I, below), but they are all late and suspect. As is the case with all famous individuals, the history of Pythagoras took on a life of its own. Stories of miracles, of divine genealogy, and of superhuman wisdom became associated with the philosopher. Making the matter murkier, others began writing treatises under his name. (See the works collected in Part II, below.) It is therefore very difficult to separate truth from fiction, Pythagoras&#x2019; doctrine from later additions. This wealth of information, however, is not so troubling. All philosophy evolves over time, but there are kernels of original doctrines present. We may not know precisely what Pythagoras taught his students, but we can be sure that his teachings included the soul&#x2019;s immortality, the cycle of birth, and the existence and beneficence of the gods.Review by Christos Evangeliou in on : <br>"This Anthology will be very precious for the serious scholars and students of philosophy, because it comprises in one volume rare Platonic, Neo-Platonic, Pythagorean and Neo-Pythagorean texts, which constitute a truly golden chain of philosophic wisdom. There was a time when Plato and Platonism were considered as synonymous with Hellenic philosophia, understood as the love of wisdom, which was expressed in theoria and, especially, in praxis, as a way of perfecting the human soul and its noetic life. Pythagoras and Socrates were acknowledged as predecessors of Plato, while succeeding generations of philosophers, including Aristotle, were seen as precious links in this continuous golden chain of wisdom. <p>This concatenation lasted for more than a millennium, until fanaticism broke it in 529 B.C., when Justinian closed down the philosophical schools in Athens. Since that time Hellenic philosophy was forced to lead an atrophic existence and to serve successively such alien masters as dogmatic theology, scientific technology and political ideology. As a result of this long enslavement, the "philosophy" of our times, especially in the West, has become a false homonym, that is an amorphous, confused, disoriented and petty sophistry. Of course, it is not what it used to be, a path to lead the philosopher&#x2019;s soul and mind to their divine perfection. </p><p>There is hope, then, that the present Anthology will help some serious and curious students of philosophy to rediscover, reconnect with, and revive the lost spirit of Platonic philosophy as a way of taking care of and perfecting the human soul in the Socratic manner. With the re-emergence of religious fanaticism and its concomitant terrorism, this Hellenic wisdom of reason and tolerance will be needed more than ever before.</p></p><h2>Working Girls</h2><p><p>What started out as a simple trip to a postcard fair turned into a lifelong investigation for author Robert Flynn Johnson. Captivated by the beauty and originality of a group of nineteenth-century photographs of women, he had to know more.</p> <p>Now, nearly a decade after his first encounter with the images, Johnson has uncovered more than two hundred vintage photographs of women who lived and worked at a brothel in Reading, Pennsylvania, circa 1892. Taken by commercial photographer William Goldman, the photographs paint a full picture of the environment that the women inhabited&#x2015;from inside the brothel, posing artistically for the camera, to their off-duty routines, such as reading, smoking, and bathing. Never-before published and taken two decades before the famous E. J. Bellocq photographs of prostitutes in Storyville in New Orleans circa 1913, these beautifully produced photographs are only now seeing the light of day. </p><p> Johnson uses these photographs to detail their aesthetic, historical, and sociological importance in the history of photography, examining them alongside paintings and photographs by such artists as Degas, Picasso, Atget, and more. Accompanied by essays from Professor Ruth Rosen and Dennita Sewell that provide an insightful historical overview of these images in context of the period in which they were taken and a preface from famed burlesque dancer Dita von Teese, this volume provides a personal visual record of lives of these women while also offering a deeper understanding of the Working Girls that existed more than 120 years ago. </p></p><p><p><strong>Robert Flynn Johnson</strong>&#x202f;is a curator emeritus, Achenbach Foundation for Graphic Arts, Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco.

In <i>Savage Spawn</i>, inspired by the schoolyard shootings that took place in Jonesboro, Arkansas, and Springfield, Oregon, in 1998, he brings his training to bear on the question of how children can become cold-blooded killers. Kellerman has as much--perhaps more--to say about the broader issue of the nature of psychopathy, however, than he does about youth violence, though he does occasionally bring the two themes together. But <i>Savage Spawn</i> is essentially a hundred-page-plus op-ed piece rooted in Kellerman's belief that there are fundamentally bad people in the world and that the response to the perpetrators of violent acts such as the shooting at Jonesboro should be to "lock them up till they die." (Although published shortly after the multiple-death shooting in Littleton, Colorado, in 1999, the book was clearly written before this incident took place.)

Peter and his fellow Apostles have just acknowledged Jesus to be Israel s long-awaited Messiah, and have been shocked by Jesus immediate prediction of his coming passion and death. Now Peter, James and John are allowed to share an extraordinary vision, marking him out as truly God s own Son, radiant with divine glory. Early Christian commentators and preachers recognized the crucial importance of this incident for Christian faith and discipleship, as pointing in advance to the power of the cross and resurrection of Christ. The liturgical feast of the Transfiguration, anticipating that of the Exaltation of the Cross by forty days, came to be celebrated in the Eastern and Western Churches, beginning in the seventh century; yet since at least the third century, theologians have reflected on the significance of this event for the life of faith.<br><br>This volume brings together, in a new translation, a comprehensive collection of homilies on the Transfiguration of Christ from the Greek Patristic and Medieval Church, from Origen in the third century to St. Gregory Palamas in the fourteenth.

In it, William Cobbett, Victorian England&#x2019;s greatest and most gifted journalist, draws upon his experiences during a two-year exile on a Long Island, New York, farm to lay out the rudiments of gardening for American farmers and, ultimately, to tailor principles developed in wet, drippy, weed-prone British gardens to their fine, sun-drenched counterparts in America. Full of practical knowledge memorably imparted with Cobbett&#x2019;s gift for the indelible phrase, <i>The American Gardener</i> offers advice still useful today on all aspects of gardening, with special attention to those plants successful in the New World, including the artichoke (&#x201c;indeed, a thistle upon a gigantic scale&#x201d;) and the increasingly ubiquitous potato. Rediscovered 180 years after its composition, <i>The American Gardener</i> is evidence of a great mind and pen at work in the earliest days of American gardens. <br><br>This Modern Library edition is published with a new Introduction by Verlyn Klinkenborg, a <i>New York Times</i> editorialist and the author of <i>The Rural Life</i>, <i>Making Hay</i>, and <i>The Last Fine Time</i>.</p><p>This 1821 book is written in William Cobbett&#39;s characteristically robust style: he starts by explaining how to establish a garden, discusses soil improvement and the building of hot-beds and greenhouses, and gives instruction on the propagation and cultivation of vegetables, fruit trees, and ornamental plants.&#x201c;Seasons wait for no man. Nature makes us her offers freely; but she will be taken at her word.&#x201d; &#x2014;William Cobbett</p><h2>Just Outside The Spotlight: Growing Up with Eileen Heckart</h2><p>Did you ever wonder what it was like to be a part of showbiz history?

That is...until now..."</p> <p>Leo "the Lion" Anderson, known to his friends as LT-a nod to his former Naval rank-let his last words hang in the air before glancing around at the four faces illuminated by the flickering beach bonfire. Rapt expressions stared back at him. He fought the grin curving his lips.</p> <p>Bingo, bango, bongo. His listeners had fallen under a spell as deep and fathomless as the great oceans themselves. It happened anytime he recounted the legend of the Santa Cristina. Not that he could blame his audience. The story of the ghost galleon, the holy grail of sunken Spanish shipwrecks, had fascinated him ever since he'd been old enough to understand the tale while bouncing on his father's knee. And that lifelong fascination might account for why he was now determined to do what so many before him-his dearly departed father included-had been unable to do. Namely, locate and excavate the mother lode of the grand ol' ship.</p> <p>Of course, he reckoned the romance and mystery of discovering her waterlogged remains were only part of the reason he'd spent the last two months and a huge portion of his savings-as well as huge portions of the savings of the others-refurbishing his father's decrepit, leaking salvage boat. The rest of the story as to why he was here now? Why they were all here now? Well, that didn't bear dwelling on.</p> <p>At least not on a night like tonight. When a million glittering stars and a big half-moon reflected off the dark, rippling waters of the lagoon on the southeast side of the private speck of jungle, mangrove forest, and sand in the Florida Keys. When the sea air was soft and warm, caressing his skin and hair with gentle, salt-tinged fingers. When there was so much...life to enjoy.</p> <p>That had been his vow-their vow-had it not? To grab life by the balls and really live it? To suck the marrow from its proverbial bones?</p> <p>His eyes were automatically drawn to the skin on the inside of his left forearm where scrolling, tattooed lettering read For RL. He ran a thumb over the pitch-black ink.</p> <p>This one's for you, you stubborn sonofagun, he pledged, flipping open the lid on the cooler sunk deep into the sand beside his lawn chair. Grabbing a bottle of Budweiser and twisting off the cap, he let his gaze run down the long dock to where his uncle's catamaran was moored. The clips on the sailboat's rigging lines clinked rhythmically against its metal mast, adding to the harmony of softly shushing waves, quietly crackling fire, and the high-pitched peesy, peesy, peesy call of a nearby black-and-white warbler.</p> <p>Then he turned his eyes to the open ocean past the underwater reef surrounding the side of Wayfarer Island, where his father's old salvage ship bobbed lazily with the tide. Up and down. Side to side. Her newly painted hull and refurbished anchor chain gleamed dully in the moonlight. Her name, Wayfarer-I, was clearly visible thanks to the new, bright-white lettering.</p> <p>He dragged in a deep breath, the smell of burning driftwood and suntan lotion tunneled up his nose, and he did his best to appreciate the calmness of the evening and the comforting thought that the vessel looked, if not necessarily sexy, then at least seaworthy. Which is a hell of an improvement.</p> <p>Hot damn, he was proud of all the work he and his men had done on her, and-</p> <p>His men...</p> <p>He reminded himself for the one hundred zillionth time that he wasn't supposed to think of them that way. Not anymore. Not since those five crazy-assed SEALs waved their farewells to the Navy in order to join him on his quest for high-seas adventure and the discovery of untold riches. Not since they were now, officially, civilians.</p> <p>"But why you guys?" The blond who was parked beneath Spiro "Romeo" Delgado's arm yanked Leo from his thoughts. "What makes you different from all those who've already tried and failed to find her?"</p> <p>"Besides the obvious you mean, mamacita?" Romeo winked, leaning back in his lawn chair to spread his arms wide. His grin caused his teeth to flash white against his neatly trimmed goatee, and Leo watched the blond sit forward in her plastic deck chair to take in the wonder that was Romeo Delgado. After a good, long gander, she giggled and snuggled back against Romeo's side.</p> <p>Leo rolled his eyes. Romeo's swarthy, Hispanic looks and his six-percent-body-fat physique made even the most prim-and-proper lady's panties drop fast enough to bust the floorboards. And this gal? Well, this gal might be prim and proper in her everyday life-hell, for all Leo knew she could be the leading expert on high etiquette at an all-girls school-but today, ever since Romeo picked her and her cute friend up in Schooner Wharf Bar on Key West with the eye-rolling line of "Wanna come see my private island?" she'd been playing the part of a good-time girl out having a little fun-in-the-sun fling. And it was the fling part that might-scratch that, rewind-did account for the lazy, self-satisfied smile spread across Romeo's face.</p> <p>"I'm serious, though." Tracy or Stacy or Lacy, or whatever her name was-Leo had sort of tuned out on the introductions-wrinkled her sunburned nose. "How do you even know where to look?"</p> <p>"Because of this." Leo lifted the silver piece of eight, a seventeenth-century Spanish dollar, from where it hung around his neck on a long, platinum chain. "My father discovered it ten years ago off the coast of the Marquesas Keys."</p> <p>Tracy/Stacy/Lacy's furrowed brow telegraphed her skepticism. "One coin? I thought the Gulf and the Caribbean were littered with old doubloons."</p> <p>"It wasn't just one piece of eight my father found." Leo winked. "It was a big, black conglomerate of ten pieces of eight, as well as-"</p> <p>"Conglomerate?" asked the brunette with the Cupid's-bow lips. Tracy/Stacy/Lacy's friend had given Leo all the right signals the minute Romeo pulled the catamaran up to Wayfarer Island's creaky old dock and unloaded their guests. It'd been instant sloe-eyed looks and shy, encouraging smiles.</p> <p>Okay, and confession time. Because for a fleeting moment when she-Sophie or Sophia? Holy Christ, Leo was seriously sucking with names tonight-sidled up next to him, he'd been tempted to take her up on all the things her nonverbal communications offered. Then an image of black hair, sapphire eyes, and a subtly crooked front tooth blazed through his brain. And just like that, the brunette lost her appeal.</p> <p>Which is a good thing, he reminded himself. You're gettin' too old to bang the Betties Romeo drags home from the bar.</p> <p>Enter Dalton "Doc" Simmons and his nearly six and a half feet of homespun, Midwestern charm. He'd been quick to insert himself between Leo and Sophie/Sophia. And now her gaze lingered on Doc's face when he said in that low, scratchy Kiefer Sutherland voice of his, "Unlike gold, which retains its luster after years on the bottom of the ocean, silver coins are affected by the seawater. They get fused together by corrosion or other maritime accretions. When that happens, it's called a conglomerate. They have to be electronically cleaned to remove the surface debris and come out looking like this." Grabbing the silver chain around his neck, Doc pulled a piece of eight from inside his T-shirt. It was identical to the one Leo wore.</p> <p>"And like this," Romeo parroted, twirling the coin on the chain around his neck like a Two-Buck Chuck stripper whirling a boa.</p> <p>Their first day on the island, Leo had gifted each of his men-damnit!...his friends-with one of the coins, telling them their matching tattoos were symbols of their shared past and their matching pieces of eight were symbols of their shared future.</p> <p>Leo tipped the neck of his beer toward Doc. "Maritime accretions, huh? You sound like an honest-to-God salvor, my friend."</p> <p>Doc smirked, which was as close to a smile as the dude ever really got. If Leo hadn't seen Doc rip into a steak on occasion, he wouldn't have been all that convinced the guy had teeth.</p> <p>"But even a conglomerate of coins wouldn't be enough to guarantee the ship's location," Leo added, turning back to the blond. "My father also found a handful of bronze deck cannons. All of which were on the Santa Cristina's manifest. So she's down there...somewhere." He just had to find her. All his friends were counting on that windfall for various reasons, and if he didn't-</p> <p>"But, like you said, your dad tried to find this Christy boat for"-Leo winced. Okay, so the woman seemed sweet. But the only thing worse than mangling the name of the legendary vessel was referring to it as a boat-"like twenty-some-odd years, right?"</p> <p>"And Mel Fisher searched for the Atocha for sixteen years before finally findin' her." He referred to the most famous treasure hunter and treasure galleon of all time. Well, most famous of all time until he and the guys made the history books, right? Right. "In shallow water, like that around the Florida Keys, the shiftin' sands are moved by wind and tide. They change the seabed daily, not to mention after nearly four centuries. But with a little hard work and perseverance, you better believe the impossible becomes possible. We're hot on her trail." Her convoluted, invisible, nonexistent trail. Shit.</p> <p>Doc slow-winked at the woman by way of agreement, twirling the toothpick that perpetually stuck out of his mouth in a circle with his tongue. It must have dazzled poor Sophie/Sophia, because she sucked in a breath before batting her pretty lashes and sidling her lawn chair closer to him. Throwing an arm around her shoulders, Doc turned to wiggle his eyebrows at Leo. Just like the others, Doc was never one to pass up an opportunity to feed Leo a heaping helping of shit. Par for the course considering Leo was...fuck a duck...used to be their commanding officer, a prime target for all their ass-hattery.</p> <p>Yeah, yeah, Leo thought, quietly chuckling. So, I pulled the Roger Murtaugh, I'm-gettin'-too-old-for-this-shit bit. And you think I screwed up royally when I turned down what she was offerin'? So, go ahead. Rub it in, you big corn-fed douche-canoe.</p> <p>"Why do you need to find that old treasure anyway?" the blond asked. "You have a private island." She motioned with her beer toward the rippling waters of the lagoon, tipsily splashing suds into the fire and making it hiss. "Aren't you r-" She hiccuped, then covered her mouth with her fingers, giggling. "Rich?" she finished.</p> <p>"Ha! Hardly." Leo rested his sweating beer bottle against the fabric of his swim trunks. Here in the Keys, shorts and swim trunks were interchangeable-unlike his possible bed partners, apparently.</p> <p>Come on, now! Why can't you get Olivia Mortier out of your head?</p> <p>And that was the question of the hour, wasn't it? Or more like the question of the last frickin' eighteen months. Ever since that assignment in Syria...</p> <p>"But if you're not rich," the blond insisted, "then how can you"-hiccup-"afford to own this place?"</p> <p>No joke, Romeo had better double-time her up to the house and into his bed. One or two more brewskies and she'd be too many sheets to the wind for what the self-styled lothario had in mind for her. Romeo may be a horndog extraordinaire, with more notches on his bedpost than Leo had sorties on his SEAL r�sum�, but like all the guys, Romeo was nothing if not honorable. If Tracy/Stacy/Lacy was too incapacitated, Romeo would do no more than tuck her under the covers with a chaste kiss on the forehead. And as their SEAL Team motto stated: Where's the fun in that?</p> <p>On cue, Romeo turned to Leo, snapping his fingers, a worried frown pulling his black eyebrows into a V. Leo hid a smile as he reopened the cooler and dug around inside until he found a bottle of water. He tossed it over the fire, and Romeo caught it one-handed. Then Mr. Slam-dunk-ovich made quick work of exchanging the blond's beer with the H2O. "Try this, m'ija," he crooned, really laying his accent on thick before leaning over to whisper something no doubt highly suggestive into her ear.</p> <p>The blond giggled, obediently twisting the cap off the water bottle to take a deep slug.</p> <p>"We don't own the island, darlin'," a deep voice called from up the beach. Leo turned to see his uncle coming toward them. The man was dressed in his usual uniform of baggy cargo shorts and an eye-bleeding hula shirt. His thick mop of Hemingway hair and matching beard glowed in the light of the moon, contrasting sharply with skin that had been tanned to leather by the endless subtropical sun.</p> <p>Bran Pallidino, Leo's best friend and BUD/S-Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL training-swim partner, had once described Leo's uncle as "one part crusty sea dog and two parts slack-ass hippie." Leo figured that pretty much summed up the ol' coot in one succinct sentence. "My great-great-I've-forgotten-how-many-greats-grandfather leased the island for one hundred and fifty years from Ulysses S. Grant."</p> <p>"President Grant?" the brunette squeaked, coughing on beer.</p> <p>"The one and only," Uncle John said, plunking himself into an empty plastic deck chair, stretching his bare feet toward the fire, and lifting a tumbler-filled with Salty Dog, John's standard grapefruit, vodka, and salted-rim cocktail-to his lips. Ice clinked against the side of the glass when he took a healthy swig. "You may not know this, Tracy," he said-Tracy. Leo snapped imaginary fingers and endeavored to commit the name to memory-"but ol' Ulysses smoked 'bout ten cigars a day. And my great-great"-Uncle John made a rolling motion with his hand-"however-many-greats-grandpappy happened to be the premier cigar-maker of the time. In exchange for a lifetime supply of high-quality Cubans, Great-Grandpappy secured the rights to make a vacation home for himself and his descendants on this here little bit of paradise for a century and a half." Uncle John's familiar Louisiana drawl-the same one Leo shared, though to a lesser extent-drifted lazily on the warm breeze.</p> <p>The Anderson brothers, Uncle John and Leo's father, James, originally hailed from the Crescent City. Like their father before them, they'd trained to be shrimp-boat captains in the Gulf. But a chance discovery during a simple afternoon dive off the coast of Geiger Key had changed everything. They'd found a small Spanish gunboat equipped with all manner of archeological riches, from muskets to daggers to swords, and the treasure-hunting bug had bitten them hard. The following year, when Leo was just five years old, the brothers moved to the Keys to use their vast knowledge of the sea to search for sunken riches instead of plump, pink shrimp.</p> <p>Unfortunately, they never found another haul that could compete with that of the gunboat. Uncle John gave up the endeavor after a decade, settling in to run one of Key West's many bars until his retirement six months ago. But Leo's father had continued with the salvage business, splitting his time between jobs and hunting for the Santa Cristina until he suffered a heart attack during a dive. Leo took solace in knowing his old man had died as he'd lived, wrapped in the arms of the sea.</p> <p>"Ulysses S. Grant? So that had to have been, what? ...</p></p><h2>Experimental Music Since 1970</h2><p><p>What is experimental music today? This book offers an up to date survey of this field for anyone with an interest, from seasoned practitioners to curious readers. This book takes the stance that experimental music is not a limited historical event, but is a proliferation of approaches to sound that reveals much about present-day experience. An experimental work is not identifiable by its sound alone, but by the nature of the questions it poses and its openness to the sounding event.</p><p>Experimentation is a way of working. It pushes past that which is known to discover what lies beyond it, finding new knowledge, forms, and relationships, or accepting a state of uncertainty. For each of these composers and sound artists, craft is developed and transformed in response to the questions they bring to their work. Scientific, perceptual, or social phenomena become catalysts in the operation of the work. </p><p>These practices are not presented according to a chronology, a set of techniques, or social groupings. Instead, they are organized according to the content areas that are their subjects, including resonance, harmony, objects, shapes, perception, language, interaction, sites, and histories. Musical materials may be subject, among other treatments, to systemization, observation, examination, magnification, fragmentation, translation, or destabilization. These restless and exploratory modes of engagement have continued to develop over recent decades, expanding the scope of both musical practice and listening.</p></p><p>An international survey of experimental music since 1970.<b>Jennie Gottschalk</b> is a composer and independent scholar based in Boston.

All your nightmares had already happened during the day.<br> <br>William Riker had always slept well. But this morning, rising was the hard part&#x2014;and he wasn&#x2019;t surprised in the least to discover he was already dressed. He&#x2019;d slept in full uniform many times as an overworked ensign, never as an admiral. But this behavior made perfect sense: He&#x2019;d been through the wringer in recent days. He was just glad he&#x2019;d made it to the bed. Falling asleep in a turbolift wouldn&#x2019;t have done, at any rank.<br> <br>He knew he&#x2019;d earned being this tired. There had been another voyage to perdition&#x2014;or worse&#x2014;just behind him, but it made his head hurt to think much about it. It didn&#x2019;t matter. The best way to escape a bad day was to start the next.<br> <br>Or to try to start it, at least. Riker&#x2019;s muscles objected as he attempted to sit up in bed, and he nearly fell back down. Standing was the next frontier, and that took longer to accomplish as well. Finally, he succeeded. Looking groggily around the VIP quarters aboard Starship Titan, he wondered for a moment where his wife was&#x2014;before remembering the vessel&#x2019;s destination was Betazed, her homeworld. That was one of the last things he&#x2019;d heard before going to sleep. Deanna had hoped to take their daughter to Betazed&#x2019;s capital city on a visit, if they had the time.<br> <br>The time. He checked it as he shambled to the mirror. Sixteen hours, he&#x2019;d slept. Riker shook his head. It was a good thing he wasn&#x2019;t on duty of any kind. But then, oversleeping was the bad dream of an ensign. Admirals&#x2019; problems were a lot worse; he&#x2019;d held the rank just long enough to learn that. And his body showed it. The face in the mirror was a fright. His dark, gently graying hair had gone this way and that during his repose, and a whole lot of new whiskers had appeared.<br> <br>&#x201c;Must have been some party,&#x201d; he mumbled. His condition owed to something else entirely, but it didn&#x2019;t matter. Drydock was about cleanup work, and that went for people just as well as their ships. He set to making himself presentable.<br> <br>A short time later found Riker in the turbolift. He didn&#x2019;t fall asleep on this ride either&#x2014;but he wouldn&#x2019;t have been able to snooze for long in any event. The doors weren&#x2019;t halfway open when a firm Vulcan voice declared, &#x201c;Admiral on the bridge!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You make a fine wake-up alarm, Tuvok.&#x201d; Riker looked over to the tactical station, where the dark-skinned Vulcan didn&#x2019;t acknowledge the joke. Tuvok simply bowed his head slightly and turned back to his console.<br> <br>Stepping onto the bridge, Riker looked up and saw through the forward viewport that Titan was indeed orbiting above Betazed, the vessel parked near a large mushroom-shaped space station. The ship had been ordered here for replacement of faulty parts for some subsystem or other; it wasn&#x2019;t Riker&#x2019;s job to know about it anymore. That responsibility lay with the woman who looked back at him from the captain&#x2019;s chair.<br> <br>&#x201c;Welcome, Admiral,&#x201d; Christine Vale said. &#x201c;How are you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Shipshape,&#x201d; Riker said, scratching his beard. &#x201c;If the ship is a garbage scow that&#x2019;s seen better days.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Forgivable, after what you&#x2019;ve&#x2014;&#x201d; Apparently thinking better of her comment, Vale stopped in midsentence and gestured ahead instead. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m afraid you missed Counselor Troi by a few minutes. She said to let you sleep.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s nice like that.&#x201d;<br> <br>Walking past the command chairs, Riker studied the scene outside more closely. He&#x2019;d never heard of Betazed Station 4 before, much less visited. Its spacedock doors were open, waiting to accept the Luna-class vessel. Just beyond the station, he could see a shuttle heading for the blue-green planet below.<br> <br>That&#x2019;s one of ours, he thought. But before he could ask about it, a chirp came from the communications officer&#x2019;s panel. &#x201c;Shuttlecraft Armstrong hailing us.&#x201d;<br> <br>Riker looked back to see Vale smiling at him. &#x201c;Someone wants to say hello,&#x201d; the redheaded woman said. &#x201c;On-screen.&#x201d;<br> <br>Turning back forward, he saw the giant image of his little dark-haired daughter waving at him. &#x201c;Hailing frequencies open, Daddy.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Hello, Natasha.&#x201d; Riker put up his hand in a slight wave and smiled wanly. &#x201c;You flying that alone?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;She wants to,&#x201d; Deanna Troi said, appearing over the child&#x2019;s shoulder. &#x201c;She takes after her father.&#x201d;<br> <br>Riker nodded. Titan&#x2019;s bridge wasn&#x2019;t really the place for a family call, and out of the corner of his eye, he could see members of the crew turning away to hide their amused expressions. Several seconds passed, silently, with neither of them talking: Deanna would have known he wouldn&#x2019;t want anyone else asking about his health, not here. She, at least, looked well rested&#x2014;and as beautiful as the day he&#x2019;d met her. &#x201c;Why did you take a shuttle?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Admiral,&#x201d; Vale said, &#x201c;we&#x2019;ve taken the transporters offline in preparation for the new upgrade equipment we&#x2019;re getting from spacedock.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Natasha thought it&#x2019;d be more fun to fly over this way,&#x201d; Deanna said. &#x201c;She likes to look at the clouds as we&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>Before Deanna could finish the sentence, an alarm screeched aboard Titan&#x2014;and Riker heard an echo from Armstrong&#x2019;s cabin, where a similar alert went off. &#x201c;Warning,&#x201d; announced a computerized voice aboard Titan. &#x201c;Plasma storm approaching, high magnitude.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Here?&#x201d; Vale seemed startled. &#x201c;We weren&#x2019;t expecting anything like that.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Origin unknown. Danger posed to orbiting vessels.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;How soon?&#x201d;<br> <br>Tuvok had the answer. &#x201c;Four point seven seconds!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Shields up!&#x201d;<br> <br>Riker looked up to Deanna on the screen. &#x201c;Deanna, shields, now!&#x201d;<br> <br>He grabbed for the railing at the rear of the bridge even as the world around him went sideways. Titan shook, apparently battered by a flood of plasma ejected from Betazed&#x2019;s sun. Yet his eyes never left the forward viewscreen. Lit by the unholy fury of whatever was outside the shuttle, Deanna clung desperately to Natasha. Riker could barely hear the child screaming over the din of impact.<br> <br>Riker looked around, not understanding. Like many other populated areas, the Betazed system was monitored by satellites that transmitted information faster than light, via subspace. Even a freak plasma storm should have been preceded by some warning before a tsunami of fire and radiation struck. And yet, here it was, shaking Titan like a tree in a hurricane.<br> <br>And Armstrong was bearing it far worse. &#x201c;Counselor!&#x201d; Vale yelled, clutching the armrests of her chair. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s your condition?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Not good!&#x201d; Internal lights strobing across her terrified face, Deanna punched at controls with one hand while hanging onto Natasha with her other arm. &#x201c;Shields failed. Losing structural integrity!&#x201d;<br> <br>Forgetting who was in command, Riker barked, &#x201c;Beam her out of there!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Engineering reports transporters will take three minutes to be placed back online,&#x201d; Vale said. &#x201c;Helm, put Titan between the solar wind and Armstrong!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;ll take a moment, Captain,&#x201d; came a voice from behind her. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re still oriented for spacedock approach.&#x201d;<br> <br>Damned repair mission! With the ship turning into the storm, Riker lurched over to a control panel whose operator had fallen away. Titan rocked and quaked, fighting against the fiery tide. Riker found his bearings and checked the ships&#x2019; relative positions, trying his best not to focus on Natasha&#x2019;s wail, now in the background but unmistakably there. &#x201c;Any ideas?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I have one, Admiral,&#x201d; Tuvok said, his fingers a blur over the keypad. &#x201c;I may be able to extend Titan&#x2019;s shields to cover the shuttle.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;At this range?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It will require reshaping the shield on the side of Titan facing the shuttle into a hyperbolic paraboloid, to maximize its range and effectiveness.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Do it!&#x201d; Vale ordered.<br> <br>&#x201c;The spatial geometry needed is complex,&#x201d; Tuvok said, seemingly calculating even as he tried to make himself heard. &#x201c;And Titan is in motion, further complicating&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>A deafening crack came from above&#x2014;followed by plummeting metal beams as the supports holding part of the bridge&#x2019;s storm-weakened ceiling gave way. One girder swung down like a club, belting Tuvok from behind and slamming him into the console. He collapsed, bleeding and senseless.<br> <br>&#x201c;Tuvok!&#x201d; Without regard for his own safety, Riker dove into the area near the collapse. Tuvok was alive but out cold.<br> <br>Vale called out to him. &#x201c;Armstrong&#x2019;s hull is failing!<br> <br>Riker stepped over the fallen Vulcan to reach his console, hoping against hope that he only needed to push a button to enact Tuvok&#x2019;s stratagem. No such luck, he saw. &#x201c;He never finished entering his equations!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Will, do something!&#x201d; It was Deanna. He looked back at the huge display screen nearly in a panic. His wife and child were in mortal danger. He was powerless to help them&#x2014;unless he could complete a mathematical sequence that it would take most people a lifetime to figure out. Still, he turned to the panel, looking at the maze of numbers and variables controlling the shields. There had to be something he could do, anything.<br> <br>Another shock shook the ship. He heard Vale&#x2019;s voice. &#x201c;Finish the sequence, Admiral!&#x201d;<br> <br>And now, Deanna. &#x201c;Do it, Will!&#x201d;<br> <br>Riker focused on the figures on the screen&#x2014;and suddenly saw clearly.<br> <br>&#x201c;I won&#x2019;t,&#x201d; he said, turning around to face the bridge crew. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not necessary.&#x201d;<br> <br>Vale was flabbergasted. &#x201c;What do you mean?&#x201d;<br> <br>Titan quaked again&#x2014;but this time, Riker wasn&#x2019;t swayed. &#x201c;I mean there is no plasma storm.&#x201d;<br> <br>From his right, a plaintive call. &#x201c;Daddy!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s enough.&#x201d; Looking stern, he faced the terrified pair on the screen. &#x201c;Whoever&#x2019;s doing this, you can stop now.&#x201d;<br> <br>The bridge shook again, and then again, until all went silent. &#x201c;As you wish,&#x201d; said a gravelly male voice behind him. Then the lights went out.</p><h2>The Woman in the Window: A Novel</h2><p><p><strong>Instant #1 <em>New York Times </em>Bestseller &#x2013; Soon to be a Major Motion Picture</strong></p><p>&#x201c;Astounding.

Acclaimed science writer Christine Kenneally explains how a relatively small group of scientists that include Noam Chomsky and Steven Pinker assembled the astounding narrative of how the fundamental process of evolution produced a linguistic ape?in other words, us. Infused with the wonder of discovery, this vital and engrossing book offers us all a better understanding of the story of humankind.</p><p>Author of <i>The Invisible History of the Human Race</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>The First Word</i>,&nbsp;<b>Christine Kenneally</b> is an award-winning journalist who has written for <i>The New Yorker</i>, the&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>, <i>Slate</i>, <i>Time</i>, <i>New Scientist</i>, <i>The Monthly</i>, and other publications.&nbsp;Before becoming a reporter, she received a PhD in linguistics from Cambridge University and a BA (with honors) in English and linguistics from Melbourne University. She was born and raised in Melbourne, Australia, and has lived in England, Iowa, and Brooklyn, New York.It never hurts to begin with a genius, so the author opens by declaring, "the story of language evolution studies is unavoidably the story of the intellectual reign of Noam Chomsky." Before Chomsky, linguists searched for new languages, wrote down vocabulary and grammar and compared them to other languages. They never addressed questions about the origin of language because conventional wisdom declared such questions could not be answered. Sixty years ago, Chomsky pointed out that infants learn to talk merely by interacting with those around them for a few years. Since conversation contains too little information to provide rules for this incredibly complex skill, humans must be born with the unique ability to learn to speak. This assertion galvanized a generation of researchers who turned their attention to the roots of language. Since Chomsky asserted that language is a uniquely human phenomenon, he doubted evolution played a role in its origin. So great was his influence that scientists have only recently overcome their inhibitions and turned up fascinating evidence to the contrary. Readers will blink as the author describes studies demonstrating that animals use language and can be taught more. Early, highly publicized experiments with apes gave the field a bad reputation because the animals seemed to be responding to trainers' cues, but careful studies make it clear that many animals can employ syntax and vocabulary at the level of a three-year-old human. Despite our vastly superior language abilities, researchers have yet to find any speech areas in the human brain that are not present elsewhere in the animal kingdom. Kenneally's book features a steady stream of brilliant, opinionated people expressing ideas that often contradict those of other brilliant people, but she channels this flood of frequently technical arguments into a comprehensible and stimulating narrative. <br> Lively portrait of a fascinating new scientific field.<br> "Kirkus" <br> All branches of science search for origins. Biologists want to know how life on earth began. Astronomers want to know how the universe got started. Even in mathematics, questions about how different numerical systems came to be constitute a legitimate line of inquiry. <br> Linguists are different. In the middle of the 19th century, the main professional bodies governing linguistic research formally banned any investigation into the origins of language, regarding it as pointless. The topic remained disreputable for more than a century, but in the last decade or so, language evolution has eased toward the front burner, attracting the attention of linguists, neuroscientists, psychologists and geneticists. Their search is the subject of The First Word, Christine Kenneallys lucid survey of this expanding field, dedicated to solving what she calls the hardest problem in science today. <br> One nut to crack is the nature of language itself, and here Ms. Kenneally introduces the unignorable presence in virtually every linguistic debate, Noam Chomsky. Mr. Chomsky and his many adherents regard language as a uniquely human endowment, centered in a specific area of the brain. It gives every living person the ability, unsought, to generate infinite strings of sentences in infinite combinations. Animals, in this view, do not have language, nor do they think. The reasons that humans speak, or how language might have made itsway to the human brain, do not matter. It may simply be that in a linguistic version of the big bang, a language mutation suddenly appeared, and that was that. <br> This view now faces many rivals. The big-bang theory has been countered by linguists who believe that just as the eye evolved to meet a need for vision, language evolved to meet the need for communication. Ms. Kenneally ushers onto the stage researchers who have discovered that many animal species possess languagelike skills previously unimagined and, without benefit of syntax or words, have a complicated inner life. They believe that the study of animal language and gestures could shed light on a possible protolanguage stage in human development. <br> The idea that language is restricted to a specific area of the brain has been more or less discarded. Brain researchers now believe that language tasks are assigned throughout the brain. Moreover, some linguists now believe that language is a two-way street. Its not something emanating from the brain of a communicating human. It actually changes the processes of the brain. Stroke victims suffering from aphasia, a condition involving language loss, do not simply find it difficult to communicate, they also find it more difficult to categorize, remember and organize information. <br> One of Ms. Kenneallys most intriguing scientists, Simon Kirby, a linguist at the University of Edinburgh who works with computer models, has proposed the idea that language might be a self-evolving phenomenon. Somewhat like a computer virus, it changes and adapts to survive. <br> Ms. Kenneally, a linguist trained at the University of Cambridge, covers an enormous expanse of ground as she brings thereader up to date on developments in a wide variety of disciplines touching on language evolution. At times, she lapses into a somewhat mechanical recitation of experiments, papers and positions, which she tries to enliven, in vain, by inserting long, unedited quotations from her interview subjects that could just as well have been paraphrased. <br> On the plus side, she explains difficult ideas concisely and clearly, and she maintains a firm grip on the steering wheel, moving the overall argument along in a straight line. Above all, she is scrupulously fair-minded. Although obviously taken with the idea of language evolution and language acquisition as a continuum seen in primitive form in other species, she gives Mr. Chomsky his due, despite his withering scorn for most of the ideas she presents, and defends him from his most vehement detractors. <br> Best of all, Ms. Kenneally zeroes in on a host of fascinating experiments. What happens when one ape trained in sign language meets another equally proficient ape for the first time? Not communication, it turns out. What resulted was a sign-shouting match; neither ape was willing to listen, Ms. Kenneally reports. <br> Mr. Kirby, the computer modeler, devised an experiment in which subjects were shown objects on a screen along with words describing the objects in what was represented as an invented alien language. The subjects were asked to learn the language. In testing one student after the other, however, Mr. Kirby added new objects to the ones already shown, whereupon the subjects unthinkingly generated new words and combinations. These changes were added to the core list and passed along to successive subjects who, trying to master the language created, in part, by each of their predecessors, made their own additions and changes. <br> Except for the initial random language given to the first subject, there was no alien language, only the contributions of each individual, which were culturally transmitted from generation to generation, Ms. Kenneally writes. Each subject in the experiment believed that he was simply giving back what he had learned, but instead the language was evolving. <br> In similar fashion, researchers have been looking at Internet sites that generate their own protolanguages and linguistic structures. <br> Ms. Kenneally concludes with a little experiment of her own. She asks many of the subjects she interviewed to imagine a group of infants stranded on the Galapagos Islands, provided with all the necessities of life but no access to speech. Would they create a language? How many babies would it take, what might their language be like, and how would it change over the generations? <br> The answers range from no language to sign language to a full-fledged language in three generations. The real point is that Ms. Kenneally could gather 15 linguists willing to think about the problem.
